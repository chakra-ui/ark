description: Implement a Zag.js component in Ark UI
---

## Steps

- Make sure the component is installed
- Install it for every framework if it’s not
- Check the `[component]-types.d.ts` file to understand it’s api and anatomy
- Implement the component similar to the `[framework]/components/avatar/src`
- Styling a component happens in `.storybook/styles` (as CSS) so we can share across frameworks
  - No Tailwind
  - No style prop
- Create an example folder and agree with me on the list of examples before working on it
- After examples are created, create or update the stories file based on the framework
- Repeat for all frameworks (please ask before moving on to the next framework)
