  Ark Components effectively.

## Install Ark UI

To start using Ark UI, you need to install it in your project. You can do so
using yarn, npm, or pnpm by running one of the following commands in your
terminal:

```bash
yarn add @ark-ui/react
## or
npm install @ark-ui/react
## or
pnpm add @ark-ui/react
```

## Creating a Slider Component

Once Ark UI is installed, you can start creating UI components. Below, we'll
demonstrate how to create a `Slider` component using Ark UI.

### Step 1: Import the Components

The preferred and most efficient way to import components is directly from the
top level, which leverages modern bundlers' tree-shaking capabilities.

Here's how you can import components directly from the top level:

```jsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

This method is recommended for most applications as tree-shaking will
automatically optimize your bundle size, including only the components you're
actually using in your final bundle.

However, in certain cases, such as when you want to improve development startup
times or if you're using an older bundler that doesn't support tree-shaking, you
can opt for path-based imports:

```jsx
import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/react/slider'
```

Regardless of the import method, once the components are imported, you can
utilize them in your application via dot notation:

```jsx
export const MySlider = () => (
  <Slider.Root>
    <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
    <Slider.Control>
      <Slider.Track>
        <Slider.Range />
      </Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Thumb key={0} index={0} />
    </Slider.Control>
  </Slider.Root>
)
```

### Step 2: Style Your Slider Component

While Ark UI is a headless UI library, it provides you with several flexible
ways to style your components to suit your application's aesthetics.

Ark UI assigns a `data-scope` and `data-part` attribute to every component part,
allowing you to use CSS selectors to target specific parts of a component.
Here's an example showing how to add styles to the `Slider` component:

```css
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='thumb'] {
  background: blue;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  border-radius: 999px;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='track'] {
  background: silver;
  height: 8px;
  flex: 1;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='range'] {
  background: orange;
  height: inherit;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='control'] {
  position: relative;
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
}
```

It's worth noting that Ark UI doesn't limit you to using CSS selectors. You can
also use class names, inline styles, or even the `asChild` prop for greater
customization and control over your components. These styling approaches make
Ark UI compatible with any styling solution, and they enable you to integrate
Ark UI with existing UI libraries seamlessly.

comprehensive [Styling Components guide](/docs/styling/overview) in our
documentation.
