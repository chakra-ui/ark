## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Exported `SelectionDetails` type for `Menu` component

### Changed

- Changed `Dialog.Description` and `Popover.Description` from `p` to `div` to
  allow for multiple paragraphs.

## [2.0.1] - 2024-01-30

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue that for some components the types were not being generated
  correctly.
- Fix issue where `Select` component submits its first option when used in a
  form, even if there is no value selected.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-01-30

### Added

- Added `TreeView` component
- Updated `@zag-js` dependencies to their latest versions, enhancing performance
  for all components.

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the `asChild` to `as` prop. The `as` prop now
  accepts a native HTML element or a custom component. For example:

```diff
- <Popover.Trigger asChild><Button>Open</Button></Popover.Trigger>
+ <Popover.Trigger as={<Button>Open</Button>} />
```

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the root types for all components to
  `<ComponentName>RootProps`. Like shown for the `Avatar` component below:

```diff
- import type { AvatarProps } from "@ark-ui/solid"
+ import type { AvatarRootProps } from "@ark-ui/solid"
```

- **Breaking Change**: Removed the `.Root` suffix for provider component like
  `Presence` and `Environment`.

```diff
- <Presence.Root>...</Presence.Root>
+ <Presence>...</Presence>
```

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the `indicator` part to `view` in the `Progress`
  component to more accurately reflect its functionality.

- Added the `ItemPreview` component to the `TagsInput` component. See the
  example below:

```diff
<TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
+  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>Delete</TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
+ </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
</TagsInput.Item>
```

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue on touch devices where selecting an item within `Combobox`,
  `Menu`, or `Select` triggered a click event on the element behind the
  portalled content.
- Fixed an issue in `PinInput` where pasting a value filled all inputs instead
  of populating them one per input.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-01-17

### Added

- Added the `Progress` component.

- Changed `PopoverDescriptionProps` type from `div` to `p`
- Replaced the styling props for indicator with CSS variables in `RadioGroup`,
  `SegmentGroup`, and `Tabs`.

### Fixed

- Fixed multiple rerenders on `Select` component using search params
- Fixed reactivity with collection in `Select` and `Combobox` components
- Fixed the issue where setting `disabled` on `Combobox` does not reflect in
  combobox item

  menu is open

  controlled context

### Fixed

  `data-part`.
- Fixed various issues for the `Toast` component that were caused by the API not
  being wrapped in an `Accessor`.

```jsx

  placement: 'top-end',
  render(toast) {
    return (
      <Toast.Root>
        <Toast.Title>{toast.title}</Toast.Title>

      </Toast.Root>
    )
  },
})

// after
const [Toaster, toast] = createToaster({
  placement: 'top-end',
  render(toast) {

      <Toast.Root>
        <Toast.Title>{toast().title}</Toast.Title>
        <Toast.Description>{toast().description}</Toast.Description>
        <Toast.CloseTrigger>Close</Toast.CloseTrigger>
      </Toast.Root>

  mounted.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-09

We are happy to announce the release of `@ark-ui/solid@1.0.0`. This release
includes a number of breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. Since our
last release over two months ago, we will only highlight some key changes.
Please refer to the documentation for each component to learn more.

### Highlights

- Revised the `Presence` component: `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` have been
  added at the root level. For some disclosure components like `Tabs` and
  `Accordion`, this constitutes a breaking change.
- Breaking changes have been implemented in `Accordion`, `ColorPicker`,
  `DatePicker`, `Dialog`, `RadioGroup`, `SegmentGroup`, `TagsInput`, `Toast`,
  and `ToggleGroup` to achieve a consistent and more intuitive API.
- Resolved various bugs and addressed accessibility issues across all
  components.

### Stability and Support

With the release of version 1.0.0, we are moving towards a more stable version
of `@ark-ui/solid`. Future updates will strive to avoid breaking changes,
ensuring a smoother experience for our users. If you encounter any issues while
upgrading, please do not hesitate to open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/issues). Your feedback is
invaluable in helping us improve.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-08

### Added

- Added `Presence` component
- To improve performance and reduce initial load times, we've introduced two new
  properties to the `AccordionContent`, `ComboboxContent`, `DialogBackdrop`,
  `DialogContent`, `HoverCardContent`, `MenuContent`, `PopoverContent`,
  `SelectContent`, and `TooltipContent` components. The `lazyMount` property
  allows for on-demand rendering of content, while the `unmountOnExit` property
  enables the removal of the component from the DOM once it's no longer
  required, ensuring better resource management and cleaner code.

  `ComboboxOptionGroup` component.

  carousel slides.

  components, such as `@ark-ui/solid/tabs` instead of the full `@ark-ui/solid`
  package. This is a significant feature for those working with bundlers that do
  not support tree-shaking. By allowing imports of individual components, we
  ensure a reduced bundle size when the full package import is not necessary.
