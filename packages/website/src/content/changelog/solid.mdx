## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-08

### Added

- Added `Presence` component
- To improve performance and reduce initial load times, we've introduced two new
  properties to the `AccordionContent`, `ComboboxContent`, `DialogBackdrop`,
  `DialogContent`, `HoverCardContent`, `MenuContent`, `PopoverContent`,
  `SelectContent`, and `TooltipContent` components. The `lazyMount` property
  allows for on-demand rendering of content, while the `unmountOnExit` property
  enables the removal of the component from the DOM once it's no longer
  required, ensuring better resource management and cleaner code.

  `ComboboxOptionGroup` component.
- Exposed `ark` factory function.

  over the carousel navigation, enabling users to directly access desired
  carousel slides.

  `Combobox` component.

  exported correctly.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-06-27

### Added

- Added `Avatar`
- Added `SegmentGroup`
- Support for standalone component imports: Developers can now import individual
  components, such as `@ark-ui/solid/tabs` instead of the full `@ark-ui/solid`
  package. This is a significant feature for those working with bundlers that do
  not support tree-shaking. By allowing imports of individual components, we
  ensure a reduced bundle size when the full package import is not necessary.
