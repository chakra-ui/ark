### Added

- Added `TreeView` component

  for all components.

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the root types for all components to
  `<ComponentName>RootProps`. Like shown for the `Avatar` component below:

```diff
- import type { AvatarProps } from "@ark-ui/react"
+ import type { AvatarRootProps } from "@ark-ui/react"
```

  `Presence` and `Environment`.

+ <Presence>...</Presence>
```

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the `indicator` part to `view` in the `Progress`
  component to more accurately reflect its functionality.

- Added the `ItemPreview` component to the `TagsInput` component. See the
  example below:

<TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value}>

+ </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
</TagsInput.Item>
```

  semantic correctness.

### Fixed

  `Menu`, or `Select` triggered a click event on the element behind the
  portalled content.
- Fixed an issue in `PinInput` where pasting a value filled all inputs instead
  of populating them one per input.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-09

We are happy to announce the release of `@ark-ui/react@1.0.0`. This release
includes a number of breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. Since our
last release over two months ago, we will only highlight some key changes.
Please refer to the documentation for each component to learn more.

### Highlights

  added at the root level. For some disclosure components like `Tabs` and
  `Accordion`, this constitutes a breaking change.
- Breaking changes have been implemented in `Accordion`, `ColorPicker`,
  `DatePicker`, `Dialog`, `RadioGroup`, `SegmentGroup`, `TagsInput`, `Toast`,
  and `ToggleGroup` to achieve a consistent and more intuitive API.
- Resolved various bugs and addressed accessibility issues across all
  components.

of `@ark-ui/react`. Future updates will strive to avoid breaking changes,
ensuring a smoother experience for our users. If you encounter any issues while
upgrading, please do not hesitate to open an issue on our

  of the component from the DOM once it's no longer required, ensuring better
  resource management and cleaner code.

### Fixed

  exported correctly.

## [0.7.1] - 2023-06-27

### Added

- Support for standalone component imports: Developers can now import individual
  components, such as `@ark-ui/react/src/srctabs` instead of the full
  `@ark-ui/react` package. This is a significant feature for those working with
  bundlers that do not support tree-shaking. By allowing imports of individual
  components, we ensure a reduced bundle size when the full package import is
  not necessary.
