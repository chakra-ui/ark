## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-09

We are happy to announce the release of `@ark-ui/react@1.0.0`. This release
includes a number of breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. Since our
last release over two months ago, we will only highlight some key changes.
Please refer to the documentation for each component to learn more.

### Highlights

- Revised the `Presence` component: `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` have been
  added at the root level. For some disclosure components like `Tabs` and
  `Accordion`, this constitutes a breaking change.
- Breaking changes have been implemented in `Accordion`, `ColorPicker`,
  `DatePicker`, `Dialog`, `RadioGroup`, `SegmentGroup`, `TagsInput`, `Toast`,
  and `ToggleGroup` to achieve a consistent and more intuitive API.
- Resolved various bugs and addressed accessibility issues across all
  components.

### Stability and Support

With the release of version 1.0.0, we are moving towards a more stable version
of `@ark-ui/react`. Future updates will strive to avoid breaking changes,
ensuring a smoother experience for our users. If you encounter any issues while
upgrading, please do not hesitate to open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/issues). Your feedback is
invaluable in helping us improve.

### Changed

  more accurate type inference for the `ref` property when dealing with both
  intrinsic HTML elements and custom React components.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-07-21

### Added

- To improve performance and reduce initial load times, we've introduced two new
  properties to the `AccordionContent`, `ComboboxContent`, `DialogBackdrop`,
  `DialogContent`, `HoverCardContent`, `PopoverContent`, `SelectContent`, and
  `TooltipContent` components. The `lazyMount` property allows for on-demand
  rendering of content, while the `unmountOnExit` property enables the removal
  of the component from the DOM once it's no longer required, ensuring better
  resource management and cleaner code.

## [0.8.1] - 2023-07-19

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue that NextJS would throw a false error because of
  `use client` annotation.

  `CarouselIndicatorGroup` components. These sub-components offer finer control
  over the carousel navigation, enabling users to directly access desired
  carousel slides.

  of child components to assist with animation processes.
- Added support to animate the `Dialog`, `Tooltip` and `Popover` elements using
  the `Presence` component. Check out the documentation for these components to
  learn more.
- Expose `use<X>Context` for all components that use context.

## [0.7.3] - 2023-07-10

  first click.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-06-30

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue that types accross various components were not being
  exported correctly.

## [0.7.1] - 2023-06-27

### Added

- Support for standalone component imports: Developers can now import individual
  components, such as `@ark-ui/react/src/srctabs` instead of the full
  `@ark-ui/react` package. This is a significant feature for those working with
  bundlers that do not support tree-shaking. By allowing imports of individual
  components, we ensure a reduced bundle size when the full package import is
  not necessary.
