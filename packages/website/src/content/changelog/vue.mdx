## [0.8.0] - 2023-09-08

### Added

  properties to the `AccordionContent`, `ComboboxContent`, `DialogBackdrop`,
  `DialogContent`, `HoverCardContent`, `MenuContent`, `PopoverContent`,
  `SelectContent`, and `TooltipContent` components. The `lazyMount` property
  allows for on-demand rendering of content, while the `unmountOnExit` property
  enables the removal of the component from the DOM once it's no longer
  required, ensuring better resource management and cleaner code.

  can be used to render a label for a group of options in the
  `ComboboxOptionGroup` component.

### Changed

  convention of other input components.

  function instead of the expected component.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-08-06

### Added

- Enhanced `Carousel` component: Introduced `CarouselIndicator` and
  `CarouselIndicatorGroup` components. These sub-components offer finer control
  over the carousel navigation, enabling users to directly access desired
  carousel slides.

  application, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the board.

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue whre the `Toast` component would not render custom content.
- Fixed an issue where standalone imports were not working as expected.
- Resolved an issue where the `SegmentGroup` component would not animate on the
  first click.

## [0.5.2] - 2023-06-27

### Added

- Support for standalone component imports: Developers can now import individual
  components, such as `@ark-ui/vue/tabs` instead of the full `@ark-ui/vue`
  package. This is a significant feature for those working with bundlers that do
  not support tree-shaking. By allowing imports of individual components, we
  ensure a reduced bundle size when the full package import is not necessary.
