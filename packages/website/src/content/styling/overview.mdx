## Styling Parts

Each component part in Ark UI is designated with `data-scope` and `data-part`
attributes. The `data-scope` attribute identifies the component, while
`data-part` specifies the individual part of the component.

> This approach aligns with the upcoming
> [CSS Scopes Specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-6/#example-463550a5).

## Styling States

Interactive components in Ark UI often include `data-*` attributes to reflect
their current state.

For example, tab trigger and content elements will have a `data-selected`
attribute when their `value` aligns with the active tab.

Additional attributes like `data-disabled`, `data-readonly`, `data-focus`,
`data-orientation`, etc., are provided to facilitate styling based on component
state.

## Integrating with Component Libraries

When integrating Ark UI with component libraries such as Chakra UI or Material
UI, the `asChild` prop allows for swapping Ark UI elements with those from your
chosen library while preserving their original functionality.

> Important: For React users, ensure that your element supports the
> `React.forwardRef` API. This is crucial for correctly forwarding the ref.

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const Demo = () => (
  <Tabs.Root>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react" asChild>
        <Button variant="outline">React</Button>
      </Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```
