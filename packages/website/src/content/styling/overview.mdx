description: Learn how to style Ark UI components.
---

Ark UI is a headless component library that is compatible with any styling
solution. And therefore compatible with any styling solution.

## Styling parts

Every component part is assigned a `data-scope` and `data-part` attribute. The
`data-scope` represents the component name, the `data-part` represents the name
of the part.

## Styling states

Most interactive components have a `data-*` attribute that represents the
current state of the component.

For instance, the tab trigger and content element will have a `data-selected`
attribute when their `value` match the current active tab.

We extensively provide data attributes like `data-disabled`, `data-readonly`,
`data-focus`, `data-orientation` and so on, to help you style the component
based on its state.

## Component Library

When using Ark UI with a component library, such as Chakra UI or Material UI,
you can use the `asChild` prop to swap the rendered element with your own while
retaining the original functionality.

> Note: If you're using React, it's important to ensure the element implements
> the `React.forwardRef` API to ensure the ref is forwarded correctly.

```tsx
import { Tabs } from '@ark-ui/react'
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const Demo = () => (
  <Tabs.Root>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger value="react" asChild>
        <Button variant="outline">React</Button>
      </Tabs.Trigger>
    </Tabs.List>
  </Tabs.Root>
)
```
