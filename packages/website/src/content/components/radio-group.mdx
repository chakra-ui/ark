## Anatomy

To set up the radio group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="radio-group" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `RadioGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Disabling the radio group

To make a radio group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

<Story id="Disabled" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the radio group's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the value
of the radio item to be selected by default.

<Story id="InitialValue" />

### Listening for changes

When the radio group value changes, the `onValueChange` callback is invoked.

<Story id="OnEvent" />
