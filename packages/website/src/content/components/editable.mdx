## Anatomy

To set up the editable correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="editable" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Editable` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Using custom controls

In some cases, you might need to use custom controls to toggle the edit and read
mode. We use the render prop pattern to provide access to the internal state of
the component.

<Story id="CustomControls" />

### Auto-resizing the editable

To auto-grow the editable as the content changes, set the `autoResize` prop to
`true`.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" autoResize>
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Setting a maxWidth

It is a common pattern to set a maximum of the editable as it auto-grows. To
achieve this, set the `maxWidth` prop to the desired value.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" autoResize maxWidth="320px">
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```

### Editing with double click

The editable supports two modes of activating the "edit" state:

- when the preview part is focused (with pointer or keyboard).
- when the preview part is double-clicked.

To change the mode to double-click, pass the prop `activationMode="dblclick"`.

```tsx
<Editable.Root placeholder="Placeholder" activationMode="dblclick">
  {/*...*/}
</Editable.Root>
```
