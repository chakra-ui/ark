<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the menu correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="menu" />

## Examples

To show the menu when a trigger element is right-clicked, use the
`Menu.ContextTrigger` component.

Context menus are also opened during a long-press of roughly `700ms` when the
pointer is pen or touch.
