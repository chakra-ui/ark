<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the tooltip correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="tooltip" />

## Getting Started

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Tooltip

To create a controlled Tooltip component, manage the state of whether the
tooltip is open using the `open` prop:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Using a Render Function

For more control over the Tooltip's functionality, you can use a function as a
child, which provides access to the Tooltip API:

<Story id="RenderFn" />

## Adding an Arrow

To display an arrow pointing to the trigger from the tooltip, use the
`Tooltip.Arrow` and `Tooltip.ArrowTip` components:

<Story id="Arrow" />

## Configuring Delay Timings

To configure the delay timings for the Tooltip, use the `closeDelay` and
`openDelay` props:

<Story id="Timings" />

## Custom Positioning

To customize the position of the Tooltip relative to the trigger, use the
`positioning` prop:

<Story id="Positioning" />

## Conclusion

The Tooltip component offers an effective way to present additional information
to users in a sleek and unobtrusive manner. Its wide range of configuration
options ensure that it can adapt to any UI design or user interaction needs.
