## Anatomy

To set up the pin input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="pin-input" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `PinInput` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Setting a default value

To set the initial value of the pin input, set the `defaultValue` prop.

<Story id="InitialValue" />

### Changing the placeholder

To customize the default pin input placeholder `○` for each input, pass the
placeholder prop and set it to your desired value.

<Story id="Customized" />

### Blur on complete

By default, the last input maintains focus when filled, and we invoke the
`onValueComplete` callback. To blur the last input when the user completes the
input, set the prop `blurOnComplete` to `true`.

<Story id="Blurred" />

### Using OTP mode

To trigger smartphone OTP auto-suggestion, it is recommended to set the
`autocomplete` attribute to "one-time-code". The pin input component provides
support for this automatically when you set the `otp` prop to true.

<Story id="OTPMode" />

### Securing the text input

When collecting private or sensitive information using the pin input, you might
need to mask the value entered, similar to `<input type="password"/>`. Pass the
`mask` prop to `true`.

<Story id="WithMask" />

### Listening for changes

The pin input component invokes several callback functions when the user enters:

- `onValueChange` — Callback invoked when the value is changed.
- `onValueComplete` — Callback invoked when all fields have been completed (by
  typing or pasting).
- `onValueInvalid` — Callback invoked when an invalid value is entered into the
  input. An invalid value is any value that doesn't match the specified "type".
