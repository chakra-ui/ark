title: Pin Input
description:
  The pin input is optimized for entering a sequence of digits or letters. The
  input fields allow one character at a time. When the digit or letter is
  entered, focus transfers to the next input in the sequence, until every input
  is filled.

<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the pin input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="pin-input" />

## Import

```ts
import {
  PinInput,
  PinInputControl,
  PinInputInput,
  PinInputLabel,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Usage

The PinInput component consists of the `PinInputControl` `PinInputInput` and
`PinInputLabel` components. Combine them as desired to fit your design system.

```tsx
<PinInput>
  <PinInputLabel>Label</PinInputLabel>
  <PinInputControl>
    <PinInputInput index={0} />
    <PinInputInput index={1} />
    <PinInputInput index={2} />
  </PinInputControl>
</PinInput>
```

### Setting a default value

To set the initial value of the pin input, set the `defaultValue` prop.

```tsx
<PinInput defaultValue="123">{/*...*/}</PinInput>
```

### Changing the placeholder

To customize the default pin input placeholder `○` for each input, pass the
placeholder prop and set it to your desired value.

```tsx
<PinInput placeholder="*">{/*...*/}</PinInput>
```

### Blur on complete

By default, the last input maintains focus when filled, and we invoke the
`onComplete` callback. To blur the last input when the user completes the input,
set the prop `blurOnComplete` to `true`.

```tsx
<PinInput blurOnComplete>{/*...*/}</PinInput>
```

### Using OTP mode

To trigger smartphone OTP auto-suggestion, it is recommended to set the
`autocomplete` attribute to "one-time-code". The pin input component provides
support for this automatically when you set the `otp` prop to true.

```tsx
<PinInput otp>{/*...*/}</PinInput>
```

### Securing the text input

When collecting private or sensitive information using the pin input, you might
need to mask the value entered, similar to `<input type="password"/>`. Pass the
`mask` prop to `true`.

```tsx
<PinInput mask>{/*...*/}</PinInput>
```

### Listening for changes

The pin input component invokes several callback functions when the user enters:

- `onChange` — Callback invoked when the value is changed.
- `onComplete` — Callback invoked when all fields have been completed (by typing
  or pasting).
- `onInvalid` — Callback invoked when an invalid value is entered into the
  input. An invalid value is any value that doesn't match the specified "type".
