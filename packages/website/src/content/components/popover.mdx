## Anatomy

To set up the popover correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="popover" />

## Getting Started

The Popover component consists of the `Popover.Trigger`, `Popover.Positioner`,
`Popover.Content`, `Popover.Title`, `Popover.Description`, `Popover.Arrow`,
`Popover.ArrowTip`, `Popover.CloseTrigger`, components.

Note that the `Popover.Trigger` and `Popover.CloseTrigger` components accept a
single JSX element which will receive all necessary props to add the event
listeners and attributes to ensure the desired accessibility.

<Story id="Basic" />

### Using a Portal

By default, the popover is rendered in the same DOM hierarchy as the trigger. To
render the popover within a portal, set the `portalled` prop to `true`.

> Note: This requires that you render the component within a `Portal` based on
> the framework you use.

<Story id="Portalled" />

### Adding an arrow

To render an arrow within the popover, render the component `Popover.Arrow` and
`Popover.ArrowTip` as children of `Popover.Positioner`.

<Story id="Arrow" />

### Listening for open and close events

When the popover is opened or closed, we invoke the `onOpenChange` callback.

<Story id="OnEvent" />

### Control the open state

Use the `isOpen` prop to control the open state of the popover.

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Modifying the close behavior

The popover is designed to close on blur and when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is
pressed.

To prevent it from closing on blur (clicking or focusing outside), pass the
`closeOnInteractOutside` prop and set it to `false`.

To prevent it from closing when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed, pass the
`closeOnEsc` prop and set it to `false`.

<Story id="CloseBehavior" />

### Changing the placement

To change the placement of the popover, set the `positioning` prop.

<Story id="Positioning" />

### Changing the modality

In some cases, you might want the popover to be modal. This means that it'll:

- trap focus within its content
- block scrolling on the body
- disable pointer interactions outside the popover
- hide content behind the popover from screen readers

To make the popover modal, set the `modal` prop to `true`. When `modal={true}`,
we set the `portalled` attribute to `true` as well.

<Story id="Modal" />
