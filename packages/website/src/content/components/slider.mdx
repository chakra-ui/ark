## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="slider" />

## Import

```ts
import {
  Slider,
  SliderControl,
  SliderLabel,
  SliderMarker,
  SliderMarkerGroup,
  SliderOutput,
  SliderRange,
  SliderThumb,
  SliderTrack,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Usage

The Slider component consists of the `SliderControl`, `SliderLabel`,
`SliderMarker`, `SliderMarkerGroup`, `SliderOutput`, `SliderRange`,
`SliderThumb`, and `SliderTrack` components. Combine them as desired to fit your
design system.

```tsx
<Slider>
  <SliderLabel>Label</SliderLabel>
  <SliderControl>
    <SliderTrack>
      <SliderRange />
    </SliderTrack>
    <SliderThumb />
  </SliderControl>
</Slider>
```

### Adding slider marks

You can add marks to the slider track by using the `SliderMarkerGroup` and
`SliderMarker` components.

Position the `SliderMarker` components relative to the track by providing the
`value` prop.

```tsx
<Slider>
  <SliderControl>
    <SliderTrack>
      <SliderRange />
    </SliderTrack>
    <SliderThumb />
  </SliderControl>
  <SliderMarkerGroup>
    <SliderMarker value={0}>0</SliderMarker>
    <SliderMarker value={25}>25</SliderMarker>
    <SliderMarker value={50}>50</SliderMarker>
    <SliderMarker value={75}>75</SliderMarker>
    <SliderMarker value={100}>100</SliderMarker>
  </SliderMarkerGroup>
</Slider>
```

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you
want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values of the
`min` and/or `max` props.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

```tsx
<Slider min={-10} max={10}>
  {/*...*/}
</Slider>
```

### Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an
integer. You can change the step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal
places, you should set the value of step to `0.01`:

```tsx
<Slider step={0.01} min={5} max={10}>
  {/*...*/}
</Slider>
```

### Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onChange` and `onChangeEnd` callbacks are
invoked. You can use this to set up custom behaviors in your app.

```tsx
<Slider
  onChange={(value) => console.log(value)}
  onChangeEnd={(value) => console.log(value)}
>
  {/*...*/}
</Slider>
```

### Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to
vertical, set the orientation property in the machine's context to vertical.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to
increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its
> height

```tsx
<Slider orientation="vertical">{/*...*/}</Slider>
```
