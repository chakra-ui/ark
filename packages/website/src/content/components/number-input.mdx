## Anatomy

To set up the number input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="number-input" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `NumberInput` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Setting a minimum and maximum value

Pass the `min` prop or `max` prop to set an upper and lower limit for the input.
By default, the input will restrict the value to stay within the specified
range.

<Story id="MinMax" />

### Adjusting the precision of the value

In some cases, you might need the value to be rounded to specific decimal
points. Set the `formatOptions` and provide `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` such as
`maximumFractionDigits` or `minimumFractionDigits`.

<Story id="FractionDigits" />

### Scrubbing the input value

The NumberInput supports the scrubber interaction pattern. To use this pattern,
render the `Number.InputScrubber` component. It uses the Pointer lock API and
tracks the pointer movement. It also renders a virtual cursor which mimics the
real cursor's pointer.

<Story id="Scrubber" />

### Using the mousewheel to change value

The NumberInput exposes a way to increment/decrement the value using the mouse
wheel event. To activate this, set the `allowMouseWheel` prop to `true`.

<Story id="MouseWheel" />

### Clamp value when user blurs the input

In most cases, users can type custom values in the input field. If the typed
value is greater than the max, the value is reset to max when the user blur out
of the input.

To disable this behavior, pass `clampValueOnBlur` and set to `false`.

<Story id="NoClamp" />

### Usage within forms

To use the number input within forms, set the `name` prop.

<Story id="FormUsage" />

### Format and parse value

To apply custom formatting to the input's value, set the `formatOptions` and
provide `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` such as `style` and `currency`.

<Story id="Formatted" />
