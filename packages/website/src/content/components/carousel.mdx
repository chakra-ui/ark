## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="carousel" />

## Getting Started

Here's an example of how to use the Carousel component with a set of images:

<Story id="Basic" />

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the
carousel using the `index` prop and update it when the `onIndexChange` event
handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Customizing the Carousel

You can customize the Carousel component by setting various props. Here's an
example of a customized Carousel:

<Story id="Customized" />
