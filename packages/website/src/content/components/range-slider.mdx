## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="slider" />

## Import

```ts
import {
  RangeSlider,
  RangeSliderControl,
  RangeSliderLabel,
  RangeSliderMarker,
  RangeSliderMarkerGroup,
  RangeSliderOutput,
  RangeSliderRange,
  RangeSliderThumb,
  RangeSliderTrack,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Usage

The Range Slider component consists of the `RangeSliderControl`,
`RangeSliderLabel`, `RangeSliderMarker`, `RangeSliderMarkerGroup`,
`RangeSliderOutput`, `RangeSliderRange`, `RangeSliderThumb` and
`RangeSliderTrack` components. Combine them as desired to fit your design
system.

```tsx
<RangeSlider>
  <RangeSliderLabel>Label</RangeSliderLabel>
  <RangeSliderControl>
    <RangeSliderTrack>
      <RangeSliderRange />
    </RangeSliderTrack>
    <RangeSliderThumb index={0} />
    <RangeSliderThumb index={1} />
  </RangeSliderControl>
</RangeSlider>
```

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you
want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values of the
`min` and/or `max` props.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

```tsx
<RangeSlider min={-10} max={10}>
  {/*...*/}
</RangeSlider>
```

### Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an
integer. You can change the step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal
places, you should set the value of step to `0.01`:

```tsx
<RangeSlider step={0.01} min={5} max={10}>
  {/*...*/}
</RangeSlider>
```

### Preventing thumb overlap

By default, the range slider thumbs are allowed to overlap when their values are
equal. To prevent this, set the prop `minStepsBetweenThumbs` to avoid thumbs
with equal values.

```tsx
<RangeSlider minStepsBetweenThumbs={1}>{/*...*/}</RangeSlider>
```

### Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onChange` and `onChangeEnd` callbacks are
invoked. You can use this to setup custom behaviors in your app.

```tsx
<RangeSlider
  onChange={(value) => console.log(value)}
  onChangeEnd={(value) => console.log(value)}
>
  {/*...*/}
</RangeSlider>
```

### Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to
vertical, set the orientation property in the machine's context to vertical.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to
increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its
> height

```tsx
<RangeSlider orientation="vertical">{/*...*/}</RangeSlider>
```
