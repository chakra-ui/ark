## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="slider" />

## Examples

You can use the `Slider` component as a range slider by setting the `value` with
an array of two numbers.

The first number is the start of the range, and the second number is the end of
the range.

<Story id="Basic" />

### Adding slider marks

You can add marks to the slider track by using the `Slider.MarkerGroup` and
`Slider.Marker` components.

Position the `Slider.Marker` components relative to the track by providing the
`value` prop.

<Story id="WithMarks" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the slider's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the array of
numbers.

<Story id="InitialValue" />

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you
want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values of the
`min` and/or `max` props.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

<Story id="MinMax" />

### Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an
integer. You can change the step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal
places, you should set the value of step to `0.01`:

<Story id="Step" />

### Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onValueChange` and `onValueChangeEnd`
callbacks are invoked. You can use this to set up custom behaviors in your app.

<Story id="OnEvent" />

### Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to
vertical, set the orientation property in the machine's context to vertical.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to
increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its
> height

<Story id="Vertical" />

### Preventing thumb overlap

By default, the range slider thumbs are allowed to overlap when their values are
equal. To prevent this, use the `minStepsBetweenThumbs` to avoid thumbs with
equal values.

<Story id="ThumbOverlap" />
