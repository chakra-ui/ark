<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="toast" />

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Toast,
  ToastCloseTrigger,
  ToastDescription,
  ToastGroup,
  ToastPlacements,
  ToastProvider,
  ToastTitle,
  useToast,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Setup

To setup the Toast environment in your application, create a `AppToastProivder`.
This provider manages the placement and grouping of toasts.

<Story id="AppToastProvider" />

Next, wrap your application in the `AppToastProvider`:

<Story id="App" />

## Basic Toast

You can create a basic Toast by using the `useToast` hook. This hook gives you
access to the `toast.create` method, which you can call to display a toast
notification:

<Story id="SimpleToast" />

## Configuring Toast

To configure the Toast component, you can pass various options to the
`toast.create` method. These options include `title`, `description`, `type`,
`placement`, `duration`, and `removeDelay`:

<Story id="ConfigureToast" />

## Custom Rendered Toast

For cases where you need more flexibility in rendering, the Toast component
offers the ability to use a custom render function. This allows you to customize
the content of the toast:

<Story id="CustomRenderToast" />

## Default Options

You can also provide default options for all toasts in your application by
passing a `defaultOptions` prop to the `ToastProvider`. This prop should be an
object with the same keys as the options object that you pass to `toast.create`:

<Story id="DefaultOptions" />

## Conclusion

The Toast component provides an intuitive and versatile solution for conveying
information to users in your applications. With its support for default options,
custom render functions, and flexible configuration, it presents a wide array of
design possibilities and use cases.
