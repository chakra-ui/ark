## Anatomy

To use the dialog component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="dialog" />

The dialog pattern consists of:

- **Trigger**: The button that triggers the dialog
- **Backdrop**: The dim background overlay that's usually behind the dialog
  element.
- **Container**: The container for the dialog's content.
- **Content**: Used to house the content of the dialog.

The dialog's content consists of:

- **Title**: The title of the dialog.
- **Description**: The description that supports the title.
- **Close Button**: The button used to close the dialog.

## Usage

Begin by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogBackdrop,
  DialogCloseTrigger,
  DialogContainer,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogPresence,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
  Portal,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Dialog

To create a controlled Dialog component, manage the state of the dialog using
the `open` and `onClose` props:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Lazy Mounting

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a dialog to be rendered
only when the dialog is first opened. This is useful for performance
optimization, especially when dialog content is large or complex. To enable lazy
mounting, use the `lazyMount` prop on the `DialogContent` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with
`lazyMount` to unmount the dialog content when the Dialog is closed, freeing up
resources. The next time the dialog is activated, its content will be
re-rendered.

<Story id="LazyMount" />

## Using Render Function

The Dialog component supports the use of a render function as a child for more
control. This allows access to dialog states like `isOpen`:

<Story id="RenderFn" />

## Conclusion

The Dialog component provides a feature-rich interface for creating dialog
windows in your applications. It provides flexibility through a variety of props
and configurations, accommodating different design requirements and use cases.
From simple modals to complex, state-controlled dialogs, the Dialog component is
a versatile tool in a developer's toolkit.
