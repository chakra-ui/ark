## Anatomy

To set up the tabs correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="tabs" />

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Tabs,
  TabList,
  TabTrigger,
  TabContent,
  TabIndicator,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here are some examples of how to use the Tabs component:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Initial Tab

To set a default tab on initial render, use the `defaultValue` prop:

<Story id="InitialTab" />

## Tab Indicator

To provide a visual cue for the selected tab, use the `TabIndicator` component:

<Story id="Indicator" />

## Lazy Mounting

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a tab to be rendered only
when the tab is first activated. This is useful for performance optimization,
especially when tab content is large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use
the `lazyMount` prop on the `TabContent` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with
`lazyMount` to unmount the tab content when the tab is deactivated, freeing up
resources. The next time the tab is activated, its content will be re-rendered.

<Story id="LazyMount" />

## Disabled Tab

To disable a tab, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `TabTrigger` component:

<Story id="DisabledTab" />

## Controlled Tabs

To create a controlled Tabs component, manage the current selected tab using the
`value` prop and update it when the `onChange` event handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Vertical Tabs

The default orientation of the tabs is `horizontal`. To change the orientation,
set the `orientation` prop to `vertical`.

<Story id="Vertical" />

## Manual Activation

By default, the tab can be selected when it receives focus from either the
keyboard or pointer interaction. This is called automatic tab activation.

In contrast, manual tab activation means the tab is selected with the

<kbd>Enter</kbd> key or by clicking on the tab.

<Story id="Manual" />

## Conclusion

The Tabs component offers a comprehensive and flexible solution for adding
tabbed navigation to your applications. With a wide variety of customization
options and features, it can accommodate various use cases and designs.
