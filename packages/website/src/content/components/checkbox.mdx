<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the checkbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="checkbox" />

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import { Checkbox, CheckboxLabel, CheckboxControl } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is an example of how to use the Checkbox component:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Checkbox

To create a controlled Checkbox component, manage the state of the checked
status using the `checked` prop and update it when the `onChange` event handler
is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Indeterminate Checkbox

In some cases, you may need a checkbox to represent a state that is neither
checked nor unchecked, known as the indeterminate state. This can be achieved by
setting the `checked` prop to `indeterminate`:

<Story id="Indeterminate" />

## Render Prop Usage

For cases where you need more flexibility in rendering, the Checkbox component
offers the use of a render prop. The render prop function gives you access to
the checkbox's API, allowing you to customize the checkbox control's rendering:

<Story id="RenderProp" />

## Conclusion

The Checkbox component provides a robust and flexible solution for toggleable
input needs in your applications. With its support for controlled and
indeterminate states, as well as custom render props, it offers a wide range of
design possibilities and use cases.
