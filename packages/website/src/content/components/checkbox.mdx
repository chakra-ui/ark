## Anatomy

To set up the checkbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="checkbox" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Checkbox` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Controlled Checkbox

To create a controlled Checkbox component, manage the state of the checked
status using the `checked` prop and update it when the `onCheckedChange` event
handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Indeterminate Checkbox

In some cases, you may need a checkbox to represent a state that is neither
checked nor unchecked, known as the indeterminate state. This can be achieved by
setting the `checked` prop to `indeterminate`:

<Story id="Indeterminate" />

### Render Prop Usage

For cases where you need more flexibility in rendering, the Checkbox component
offers the use of a render prop. The render prop function gives you access to
the checkbox's API, allowing you to customize the checkbox control's rendering:

<Story id="RenderProp" />
