## Anatomy

To set up the pagination correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="pagination" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Pagination` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Controlled Pagination

To create a controlled Pagination component, manage the state of the current
page using the `page` prop and update it when the `onPageChange` event handler
is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Customizing Pagination

You can customize the Pagination component by setting various props such as
`dir`, `pageSize`, `siblingCount`, and `translations`. Here's an example of a
customized Pagination:

<Story id="Customized" />
