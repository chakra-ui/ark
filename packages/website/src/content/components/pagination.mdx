<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the pagination correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="pagination" />

## Getting Started

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Pagination

To create a controlled Pagination component, manage the state of the current
page using the `page` prop and update it when the `onPageChange` event handler
is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Customizing Pagination

You can customize the Pagination component by setting various props such as
`dir`, `pageSize`, `siblingCount`, and `translations`. Here's an example of a
customized Pagination:

<Story id="Customized" />

## Conclusion

The Pagination component offers an intuitive and flexible solution for managing
paginated content in your applications. With its extensive set of features and
customization options, it can accommodate a wide range of use cases and designs.
