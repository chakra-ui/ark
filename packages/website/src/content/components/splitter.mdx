description: A component that divides your interface into resizable sections

import { Anatomy, ComponentPreview, Story } from '~/components/docs'

<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the splitter correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="splitter" />

## Getting Started

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import { Splitter, SplitterPanel, SplitterResizeTrigger } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Using Render Props

The Splitter component allows you to pass a function as a child to gain direct
access to its API. This provides more control and allows you to modify the size
of the panels programmatically:

<Story id="RenderProp" />

## Handling Events

Splitter also provides `onResizeStart` and `onResizeEnd` events which can be
useful to perform some actions during the start and end of the resizing process:

<Story id="Events" />

## Vertical Splitter

By default, the Splitter component is horizontal. If you need a vertical
splitter, use the `orientation` prop:

<Story id="Vertical" />

## Conclusion

The Splitter component provides an intuitive way to divide your user interface
into multiple resizable sections. With the use of its API, event handlers, and
props, you can achieve a high level of control and customization, accommodating
a wide range of design and functionality needs.
