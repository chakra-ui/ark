## Anatomy

To set up the switch correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="switch" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Switch` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Controlled Switch

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the
checked prop, and updates when the `onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Render Prop Usage

The Switch component also allows for a render prop, granting direct access to
its internal state. This enables you to dynamically adjust and customize aspects
of the component based on its current state:

<Story id="RenderProp" />
