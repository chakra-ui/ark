<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the switch correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="switch" />

## Getting Started

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Switch

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the
checked prop, and updates when the `onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Render Prop Usage

The Switch component also allows for a render prop, granting direct access to
its internal state. This enables you to dynamically adjust and customize aspects
of the component based on its current state:

<Story id="RenderProp" />

## Conclusion

The Switch component provides a straightforward, intuitive solution for
incorporating toggle functionality into your applications. With its flexibility
for both controlled and uncontrolled scenarios and provision for dynamic
customization through its render prop, it can accommodate various use cases
effectively.
