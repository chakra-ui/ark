## Anatomy

To set up the menu correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="menu" />

## Examples

To show a nested menu, render another `Menu` component and use the
`Menu.TriggerItem` component to open the submenu.

<Story id="Basic" />

### Checkbox and Radio option items

To show a checkbox or radio option item, use the `Menu.OptionItem` component.
Depending on the `type` prop, the item will be rendered as a checkbox or radio
option item. The `name` prop is used to group the items together, and the
`value` prop is used to identify the item.

To manage the state of the option items pass the `value` and `onValueChange`
props to the `Menu` component.
