## Anatomy

To set up the avatar correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="avatar" />

## Getting Started

<Story id="Basic" />

## Handling Events

`Avatar` allows you to listen for loading state changes.

<Story id="Events" />
