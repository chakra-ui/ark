<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the rating correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="rating-group" />

## Getting Started

<Story id="Basic" />

### Using half ratings

Allow `0.5` value steps by setting the `allowHalf` prop to `true`. Ensure to
render the correct icon if the `isHalf` value is set in the Rating components
render callback.

<Story id="HalfRatings" />

### Using a default value

<Story id="InitialValue" />

### Controlled

When using the `RatingGroup` component, you can use the `value` and
`onValueChange` props to control the state.

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Disabling the rating group

To make the rating group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

<Story id="Disabled" />

### Readonly rating group

To make the rating group readonly, set the `readOnly` prop to `true`.

<Story id="ReadOnly" />

### Usage within forms

To use the rating group within forms, pass the prop `name`. It will render a
hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form correctly.

<Story id="FormUsage" />
