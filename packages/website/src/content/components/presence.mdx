id: presence
title: Presence
description:
  The Presence is a practical and versatile component that helps control the
  rendering and unmounting of your content based on a given state. It's designed
  to work seamlessly with animations, ensuring smooth transitions and full
  visibility of animations before any changes in presence are made.
---

import Story from '~/components/story.astro'

## Usage

To use the Presence component, import it from the package:

```tsx
import { Presence } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

By default the child component starts out as hidden and remains hidden after the
`present` state is toggled off. This is useful for situations where the element
needs to be hidden initially and continue to stay hidden after its presence is
no longer required.

<Story id="Basic" />

## Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of a child component until the `present` prop is set to
true, use the `lazyMount` prop:

<Story id="LazyMount" />

## Unmount on Exit

To remove the child component from the DOM when it's not present, use the
`unmountOnExit` prop:

<Story id="UnmountOnExit" />

## Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined for a component to be
mounted only when it's present and to be unmounted when it's no longer present:

<Story id="LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit" />

## Conclusion

The Presence component provides an efficient way to control the rendering of
components based on a specific condition. Its compatibility with animations
offers a smooth and polished user experience. It is highly flexible and can be
used to greatly improve the performance and user experience of your React
application.
