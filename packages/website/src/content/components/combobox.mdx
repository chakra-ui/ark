<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="combobox" />

## Basic Usage

Straightforward implementation using a simple array to populate the dropdown.

<Story id="Basic" />

## Advanced Customization
