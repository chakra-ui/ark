## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="combobox" />

On a high level, the combobox consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the combobox
- **Label**: The label that gives the user information on the combobox
- **Positioner**: The element that positions the combobox dynamically.
- **Content**: The element that contains the options.
- **Trigger**: The element that toggles the combobox menu.
- **Control**: The element that contains the input and trigger.
- **Input**: The element that receives user input.
- **Item**: The combobox item or option element.
- **ItemIndicator**: The element that indicates the selected item.
- **ItemGroup**: The element used to group related items.

## Basic Usage

Straightforward implementation using a simple array to populate the dropdown.
