## Anatomy

To set up the progress correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

{/* <Anatomy id="progress" /> */}

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Progress` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the progress's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to a number.

<Story id="InitialValue" />

### Specifying the maximum

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily
specify a different bound by changing the value of the `max` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress to `30`, you can use:

<Story id="Max" />

### Changing the orientation

By default, the progress is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation
to vertical, set the orientation property in the machine's context to vertical.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical progress by specifying its
> height

<Story id="Vertical" />

### Using as a circular progress

You can use the `Progress` component as a circular progress by replacing
`Progress.Track` and `Progress.Range` with `Progress.CircleTrack` and
`Progress.CircleRange`.

Remember to add `Progress.Circle` as a container for range and track.

<Story id="Range" />
