## Anatomy

To set up the menu correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="menu" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Menu` component in your project. Let's take a look at the
most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Listening to item selection

Pass the `onSelect` prop to the Menu component to perform some custom logic when
an item is selected. The callback is invoked with the `id` of the item.

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Grouping menu items

When the number of menu items gets much, it might be useful to group related
menu items. To achieve this, render the `Menu.ItemGroup` component around the
`Menu.Item` components. The `Menu.ItemGroupLabel` component can be used to add a
label to the group.

<Story id="Group" />

### Separating menu items

To separate menu items, render the `Menu.Separator` component.

<Story id="Separator" />

### Checkbox and Radio option items

To show a checkbox or radio option item, use the `Menu.OptionItem` component.
Depending on the `type` prop, the item will be rendered as a checkbox or radio
option item. The `name` prop is used to group the items together, and the
`value` prop is used to identify the item.

To manage the state of the option items pass the `value` and `onValueChange`
props to the `Menu` component.

<Story id="Options" />
