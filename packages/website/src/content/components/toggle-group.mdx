## Anatomy

To set up the toggle group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="toggle-group" />

## Basic Usage

A simple example with three toggles: A, B, and C.

<Story id="Basic" />

## Multiple Selection

Demonstrates how to enable multiple selection within the group.

<Story id="Multiple" />

## Initial Value
