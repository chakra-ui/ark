## Anatomy

To set up the accordion correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="accordion" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Accordion` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Setting an Initial Panel

To set an initial panel to be open upon rendering, use the `defaultValue` prop:

<Story id="Initial" />

### Using Render Props

For more control over the Accordion's functionality, you can use a function as a
child, which provides access to the Accordion API:

<Story id="RenderProp" />

### Making the Accordion Collapsible

For a collapsible Accordion where all panels can be closed simultaneously, use
the `collapsible` prop:

<Story id="Collapsible" />

### Opening Multiple Panels

For an Accordion that allows multiple panels to be open at once, use the
`multiple` prop:

<Story id="Multiple" />

### Controlled Accordion

To create a controlled Accordion component, manage the state of the currently
opened panels using the `value` prop and update it when the `onValueChange`
event handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Changing the Orientation

To display the Accordion in a vertical orientation, use the `orientation` prop:

<Story id="Vertical" />

### Disabling an Accordion Item

To disable an Accordion.Item, use the `disabled` prop:

<Story id="Disabled" />
