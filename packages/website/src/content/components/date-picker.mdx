import { Story, ComponentPreview } from '~/components/docs'

<ComponentPreview />

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  DatePicker,
  DatePickerControl,
  DatePickerInput,
  DatePickerTrigger,
  DatePickerClearTrigger,
  DatePickerContent,
  DatePickerYearSelect,
  DatePickerMonthSelect,
  DatePickerPrevTrigger,
  DatePickerViewTrigger,
  DatePickerNextTrigger,
  DatePickerGrid,
  DatePickerRowHeader,
  DatePickerColumnHeader,
  DatePickerRowGroup,
  DatePickerRow,
  DatePickerDayCell,
  DatePickerDayCellTrigger,
  DatePickerMonthCell,
  DatePickerMonthCellTrigger,
  DatePickerYearCell,
  DatePickerYearCellTrigger,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is an example of how to use the Date Picker component:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Range Selection with Single Grid

To create a Date Picker that allows a range selection, set the `selectionMode`
prop to "range". This renders a single grid view where the user can select a
start and end date:

<Story id="RangeWithSingleGrid" />

## Range Selection with Two Grids

In some cases, you might want to display two consecutive months at the same time
to facilitate a broader range selection. This can be achieved by setting the
`numOfMonths` prop to `2`:

<Story id="RangeWithTwoGrids" />

## Conclusion

The Date Picker component provides a versatile solution for date selection needs
in your applications. With support for different view modes, single and range
date selection, and the ability to render multiple grids, it offers a wide range
of customization and usability options.
