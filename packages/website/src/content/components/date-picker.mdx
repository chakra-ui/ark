## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="date-picker" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `DatePicker` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example

<Story id="Basic" />

### Range Selection with Single Grid

To create a Date Picker that allows a range selection, set the `selectionMode`
prop to "range". This renders a single grid view where the user can select a
start and end date:

<Story id="RangeWithSingleGrid" />

### Range Selection with Two Grids

In some cases, you might want to display two consecutive months at the same time
to facilitate a broader range selection. This can be achieved by setting the
`numOfMonths` prop to `2`:

<Story id="RangeWithTwoGrids" />
