## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="date-picker" />

## Examples

<Story id="Basic" />

### Standalone Date Picker

In some cases, you might want to display a non-dismissable date picker. This can
be achieved by setting the `open` prop to `true` and `closeOnSelect` prop to
`false`.

> Important to note that standalone date picker doesn't use the `Portal`,
> `Positioner` and `Content` components.
