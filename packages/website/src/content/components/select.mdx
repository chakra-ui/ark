## Anatomy

To set up the select correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="select" />

On a high level, the select consists of:

- **Label**: The element that labels the select.
- **Trigger**: The element that is used to open/close the select.
- **Positioner**: The element that positions the select dynamically.
- **Content**: The popup element that contains the options.
- **Item**: The select item or option element.
- **ItemIndicator**: The element that indicates the selected item.
- **ItemGroup**: The element used to group related items.

## Basic Usage

For a straightforward implementation of the Select component:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Advanced Customization

For advanced customizations and item properties like disabled:

<Story id="Advanced" />

## Multiple Selection

To enable multiple item selection:

<Story id="Multiple" />

## Controlled Component

For scenarios where you want to control the Select component's state:

<Story id="Controlled" />
