## Anatomy

To set up the color picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="color-picker" />

## Examples

### Controlled Color Picker

color using the `value` prop and update it when the `onValueChange` event
handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />
