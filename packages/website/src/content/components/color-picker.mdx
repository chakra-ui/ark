import { Anatomy, Story, ComponentPreview } from '~/components/docs'

<ComponentPreview />

## Anatomy

To set up the color picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="color-picker" />

## Getting Started

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Color Picker

To create a controlled Color Picker component, manage the state of the current
color using the `value` prop and update it when the `onValueChange` event
handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Conclusion

The Color Picker component offers a flexible and powerful solution for
integrating color selection into your applications. With its comprehensive set
of features and customizability, it can accommodate a wide range of use cases
and designs.
