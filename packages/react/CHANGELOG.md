  > node properties.

  ```ts
  const tree = new TreeCollection({
    rootNode: {
      value: 'ROOT',
      children: [{ value: 'child1' }, { value: 'child2' }],
    },
  })

  const flattened = tree.flatten()
  const reconstructed = flattenedToTree(flattened)

  console.log(reconstructed.rootNode)

  // {
  //   value: "ROOT",
  //   children: [{ value: "child1" }, { value: "child2" }],
  // }
  ```

## [5.0.0] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! 🚀

### What’s new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** – Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using React’s native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

![Performance comparison showing Ark v5 is 1.5x-4x faster than other libraries](./v5.svg)

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```
