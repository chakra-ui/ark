## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

## [5.25.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/react/utils'
```

### Fixed

- **AngleSlider**: Export `angleSliderAnatomy` from the anatomy exports

## [5.24.1] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.24.0] - 2025-09-14

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Menu**:
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.23.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

### Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix `Menu.ItemText` not working inside `Menu.TriggerItem`

  ```tsx
  import { Select } from '@ark-ui/react/select'
  import { styled } from 'styling-lib'

  const Root = styled(Select.Root) as Select.RootComponent<{}>
  ```

## [5.22.0] - 2025-08-28

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

  `ToastStatusChangeDetails`, and `ToastType`

    area.

    constraints.

    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **Scroll Area**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Combobox**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Tabs**: Fix inconsistent keyboard navigation where TabPanel intermittently receives focus before focusable elements

- **Carousel**:
  - Fix an issue where the carousel would not update when `slideCount` or `autoplay` props change.

    last slide.

## [5.18.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- **Collection**: Add `useListSelection` hook for managing collection item selection with support for single/multiple
  selection modes

  ```jsx
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'] })
  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('React')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('React')
  selection.toggle('Vue')
  ```

- **File Upload**: Add support for programmatically controlling the accepted files via `acceptedFiles` and
  `defaultAcceptedFiles`

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for programmatically controlling the paths via `paths` and `defaultPaths` props.

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

  - Fix issue where calling `api.setFiles` invokes validation with incorrect `acceptedFiles`
  - Fix issue where the browser might not be able to infer the mime type of a file due to limitations, drag source or

    extension.

  ```ts
  const tree = new TreeCollection({
    rootNode: {
      value: 'ROOT',
      children: [{ value: 'child1' }, { value: 'child2' }],
    },

## [5.0.0] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! 🚀

### What’s new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** – Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using React’s native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

![Performance comparison showing Ark v5 is 1.5x-4x faster than other libraries](./v5.svg)

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(<ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```
