## Installation

Install Ark by running either of the following:

```bash
yarn add @ark-ui/react
## or
npm install @ark-ui/react
## or
pnpm add @ark-ui/react
```

## Using the components

The example below demonstrate how to create a Slider component with Ark.

### 1. Import the components

The slider component exposes several parts that you can use to build your own
slider. Importing the `Slider` component will give you access to all its parts
via the dot notation.

```jsx
import {
  Slider,
  SliderLabel,
  SliderControl,
  SliderThumb,
  SliderTrack,
  SliderRange,
} from '@ark-ui/react'

export const SliderDemo = () => {
  return (
    <Slider>
      <SliderLabel>Label</SliderLabel>
      <SliderControl>
        <SliderTrack>
          <SliderRange />
        </SliderTrack>
        <SliderThumb />
      </SliderControl>
    </Slider>
  )
}
```

### 2. Add your styles

The slider is headless by default but you can add your own styles to it.

> Every part of the slider's anatomy has a `data-part` attribute that you can
> use to target the specific part of the slider.

The example below shows how to add styles to the slider.

```css
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='thumb'] {
  background: blue;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  border-radius: 999px;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='track'] {
  background: silver;
  height: 8px;
  flex: 1;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='control'] {
  position: relative;
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
}
```

That's it! With a few lines of code and some sprinkle of CSS, we've implemented
a fully accessible Slider component that:

- Adheres to WAI-ARIA design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Supports keyboard navigation.
- Supports mouse and touch events.
- Supports RTL languages.

> The components are low-level and atomic by design to allow you wrap them into
> your own high-level API that suits your team's conventions.
