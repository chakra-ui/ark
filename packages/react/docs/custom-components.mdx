## Understanding The Problem

Traditional UI frameworks come with pre-designed, opinionated components such as
a `<Pagination />`. These components are bundled with pre-configured styles and
a set of predefined props that control the appearance and behavior of the
component. This is very convenient and helpful at the beginning of the
development phase.

However, there is a downside to this convenience. These predefined components
limit your design choices to just theming (CSS) and tweaking the component's API
(Props) to alter its design and behavior. This often becomes a bottleneck when
you want to give your UI a unique touch or incorporate business-specific
requirements that aren't supported by the given API. For example, you might want
a highly customized `Pagination` component that differs significantly from the
standard model, but the opinionated framework might not support your desired
configuration or style.

## How Ark Solves This Problem

Ark is an un-opinionated component framework that empowers developers with the
flexibility to create their own custom components. Unlike traditional UI
frameworks, Ark does not constrain you to a particular component API or theming.

Before we delve into how to create a custom component using Ark, let's
understand what Ark is and why it is special. Ark is a UI framework that puts
the control in the hands of developers. It does not enforce strict design
decisions, instead providing a flexible platform that allows developers to
create components that align with their specific needs and preferences.

Now let's see how you can use Ark to create custom components that perfectly
align with your unique design choices and specifications.

## Creating a Custom Component

Consider this basic implementation of a `Pagination` component:

```tsx
<Pagination count={5000} pageSize={10} siblingCount={2}>
  {({ pages }) => (
    <PaginationList>
      <PaginationListItem>
        <PaginationPrevPageTrigger>Previous Page</PaginationPrevPageTrigger>
      </PaginationListItem>
      {pages.map((page, index) =>
        page.type === 'page' ? (
          <PaginationListItem key={index}>
            <PaginationPageTrigger {...page}>
              {page.value}
            </PaginationPageTrigger>
          </PaginationListItem>
        ) : (
          <PaginationListItem key={index}>
            <PaginationEllipsis index={index}>&#8230;</PaginationEllipsis>
          </PaginationListItem>
        ),
      )}
      <PaginationListItem>
        <PaginationNextPageTrigger>Next Page</PaginationNextPageTrigger>
      </PaginationListItem>
    </PaginationList>
  )}
</Pagination>
```

While functional, this approach could become verbose if you need to implement a
`Pagination` component frequently, requiring ~30 lines of code each time.
Furthermore, this approach does not accommodate your specific design
preferences, such as component structure, style, and default values.

To streamline this process, you can create a reusable `CustomPagination`
component using Ark. This component will be a wrapper around the `Pagination`
component and it will incorporate your specific design and styling preferences.

```tsx
import { type PaginationProps } from '@ark-ui/solid'

interface CustomPaginationProps extends Pick<PaginationProps, 'count' | 'pageSize' | 'siblingCount'> {
  // Add any other props you might need
}

const CustomPagination = (props: CustomPaginationProps) => {
  const { count = 1000, pageSize = 10, siblingCount = 1 } = props
  return (
    <Pagination count={count} pageSize={pageSize} siblingCount={siblingCount}>
      {({ pages }) => (
        /* Implementation details here */
      )}
    </Pagination>
  )
}
```

In this code, `CustomPaginationProps` is an interface that extends the
predefined `PaginationProps` from Ark. This interface represents the properties
that the `CustomPagination` component accepts. We've set default values for the
`count`, `pageSize`, and `siblingCount` props in the `CustomPagination`
component, but you can override these defaults when using the component.

## Conclusion

The power of Ark lies in its flexibility and customizability. By offering
developers the freedom to design their components, Ark paves the way for a user
interface that perfectly reflects the unique design decisions and
business-specific requirements of your application.

Remember, the `CustomPagination` component is just an example. The same
principles can be applied to create other reusable components that reflect your
specific needs and preferences, making your code cleaner, more maintainable, and
more consistent. Be sure to explore the full range of props available in the
base components and consider how they might be used to further enhance your
custom components.
