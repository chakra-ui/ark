## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  ColorPicker,
  ColorPickerArea,
  ColorPickerAreaGradient,
  ColorPickerAreaThumb,
  ColorPickerChannelInput,
  ColorPickerContent,
  ColorPickerEyeDropperTrigger,
  ColorPickerSliderThumb,
  ColorPickerSliderTrack,
  ColorPickerSwatch,
  ColorPickerSwatchGroup,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is an example of how to use the Color Picker component:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Uncontrolled Component

In the uncontrolled use case, you don't need to manage the state of the Color
Picker component. Instead, you can provide a defaultValue prop to set the
initial value, and use the onChange and onChangeEnd event handlers to get the
selected color:

```tsx
export const Uncontrolled = () => {
  const handleColorChange = (details) => {
    console.log('Color changed:', details.value)
  }

  const handleColorChangeEnd = (details) => {
    console.log('Color change ended:', details.value)
  }

  return (
    <ColorPicker
      defaultValue="#ff0000"
      onChange={handleColorChange}
      onChangeEnd={handleColorChangeEnd}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </ColorPicker>
  )
}
```

## Controlled Component

In the controlled use case, you can manage the state of the Color Picker
component by using the `value` prop and updating it when the `onChange` or
`onChangeEnd` event handlers are called:

```tsx
export const Controlled = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('#ff0000')

  return (
    <ColorPicker value={color} onChange={(details) => setColor(details.value)}>
      {/* ... */}
    </ColorPicker>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

The Color Picker component offers a flexible and powerful solution for
integrating color selection into your applications. With its comprehensive set
of features and customizability, it can accommodate a wide range of use cases
and designs.
