## Usage

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

  TooltipContent,
  TooltipPositioner,
  TooltipPresence,
  TooltipTrigger,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Using a Render Function

For more control over the Tooltip's functionality, you can use a function as a
child, which provides access to the Tooltip API:

<Story name="RenderFn" />

## Controlled Tooltip

To create a controlled Tooltip component, manage the state of whether the
tooltip is open using the `open` prop:

<Story name="Controlled" />

## Adding an Arrow

To display an arrow pointing to the trigger from the tooltip, use the
`TooltipArrow` and `TooltipArrowTip` components:

<Story name="Arrow" />

## Configuring Delay Timings

To configure the delay timings for the Tooltip, use the `closeDelay` and
`openDelay` props:

<Story name="Timings" />

## Custom Positioning

To customize the position of the Tooltip relative to the trigger, use the
`positioning` prop:

<Story name="Positioning" />

## Conclusion

The Tooltip component offers an effective way to present additional information
to users in a sleek and unobtrusive manner. Its wide range of configuration
options ensure that it can adapt to any UI design or user interaction needs.
