  where you need to offer users tips or help text.
---

## Usage

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Portal,
  Tooltip,
  TooltipArrow,
  TooltipArrowTip,
  TooltipContent,
  TooltipPositioner,
  TooltipPresence,
  TooltipTrigger,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Using a Render Function

For more control over the Tooltip's functionality, you can use a function as a
child, which provides access to the Tooltip API:

<Story name="RenderFn" />

## Controlled Tooltip

To create a controlled Tooltip component, manage the state of whether the
tooltip is open using the `open` prop:

<Story name="Controlled" />

## Adding an Arrow

To display an arrow pointing to the trigger from the tooltip, use the
`TooltipArrow` and `TooltipArrowTip` components:

<Story name="Arrow" />

## Adding Animation

To add an animation to the Tooltip, use the `TooltipPresence` component. Here is
a basic example using a fadeIn / fadeOut animation:

```css
[data-part='content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: fadeIn 0.25s ease-out;
}
[data-part='content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: fadeOut 0.2s ease-in;
}
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

## Configuring Delay Timings

To configure the delay timings for the Tooltip, use the `closeDelay` and
`openDelay` props:

<Story name="Timings" />

## Custom Positioning

To customize the position of the Tooltip relative to the trigger, use the
`positioning` prop:

<Story name="Positioning" />

## Conclusion

The Tooltip component offers an effective way to present additional information
to users in a sleek and unobtrusive manner. Its wide range of configuration
options ensure that it can adapt to any UI design or user interaction needs.
