## Import

```ts
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionTrigger,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionContent,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Usage

The Accordion component consists of the `Accordion`, `AccordionTrigger`,
`AccordionItem` and `AccordionContent` components.

<Story name="Basic" />

### Allow toggling the open state

To collapse an already expanded accordion item by clicking on it, set the
`collapsible` prop property to `true`.

> If `multiple` is `true`, we internally set `collapsible` to be true.

<Story name="Collapsible" />

### Allow multiple open accordions at once

To allow multiple items to be expanded at once, set `multiple` to `true`. This
mode implicitly sets `collapsible` to `true` and ensures that each accordion can
be expanded.

<Story name="Multiple" />

### Disable specific accordion items

To disable a specific accordion item, set the `disabled` prop to `true`. When an
accordion item is disabled, it is skipped from keyboard navigation and can't be
interacted with.

<Story name="Disabled" />

### Uncontrolled usage with defaultValue

Expand accordion items by default with setting `defaultValue` to the value of an
`AccordionItem`. The `defaultValue` should be of type `string | string[] | null`

<Story name="Uncontrolled" />

### Controlled usage with value and onChange

The accordion item accepts a `value` and `onChange` prop, to allow a controlled
usage. The `value` prop should be of type `string | string[] | null`.
