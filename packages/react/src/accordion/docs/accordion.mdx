# Accordion

An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings containing a title, content
snippet, or thumbnail representing a section of content.

## Import

```ts
import { Accordion, AccordionButton, AccordionItem, AccordionPanel } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Usage

The Accordion component consists of the `Accordion`, `AccordionButton`, `AccordionItem` and
`AccordionPanel` components.

### Plain

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 1 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 1 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 2 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 2 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Allow toggling the open state

To collapse an already expanded accordion item by clicking on it, set the `collapsible` prop
property to `true`.

:::note

If `multiple` is `true`, we internally set collapsible to be true.

:::

```tsx
<Accordion collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 1 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 1 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 2 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 2 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Allow multiple open accordions at once

To allow multiple items to be expanded at once, set `multiple` to `true`. This mode implicitly sets
`collapsible` to `true` and ensures that each accordion can be expanded.

```tsx
<Accordion multiple>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 1 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 1 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 2 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 2 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Disable specific accordion items

To disable a specific accordion item, set the `disabled` prop to `true`. When an accordion item is
disabled, it is skipped from keyboard navigation and can't be interacted with.

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1" disabled>
    <AccordionButton>Panel 1 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 1 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 2 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 2 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Uncontrolled usage with `defaultValue`

Expand accordion items by default with setting `defaultValue` to the value of an `AccordionItem`.
The `defaultValue` should be of type `string | string[] | null`

```tsx
<Accordion defaultValue="panel-2">
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 1 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 1 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionButton>Panel 2 trigger</AccordionButton>
    <AccordionPanel>Panel 2 content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Controlled usage with `value` and `onChange`

The accordion item accepts a `value` and `onChange` prop, to allow a controlled usage. The `value`
prop should be of type `string | string[] | null`.

```tsx
export const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState<string | string[] | null>('panel-2')
  return (
    <Accordion value={value} onChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      {['panel-1', 'panel-2', 'panel-3'].map((id) => (
        <AccordionItem key={id} value={id}>
          <AccordionButton>{id} trigger</AccordionButton>
          <AccordionPanel>{id} content</AccordionPanel>
        </AccordionItem>
      ))}
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```
