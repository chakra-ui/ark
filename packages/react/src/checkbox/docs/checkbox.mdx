name: Checkbox
description:
  The Checkbox is a widely used input component for toggling between checked and
  unchecked states. It supports basic, controlled, and indeterminate states.
---

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import { Checkbox, CheckboxLabel, CheckboxControl } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is an example of how to use the Checkbox component:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Controlled Checkbox

To create a controlled Checkbox component, manage the state of the checked
status using the `checked` prop and update it when the `onChange` event handler
is called:

<Story name="Controlled" />

## Indeterminate Checkbox

In some cases, you may need a checkbox to represent a state that is neither
checked nor unchecked, known as the indeterminate state. This can be achieved by
setting the `checked` prop to `indeterminate`:

<Story name="Indeterminate" />

## Render Prop Usage

For cases where you need more flexibility in rendering, the Checkbox component
offers the use of a render prop. The render prop function gives you access to
the checkbox's API, allowing you to customize the checkbox control's rendering:

<Story name="RenderProp" />

## Conclusion

The Checkbox component provides a robust and flexible solution for toggleable
input needs in your applications. With its support for controlled and
indeterminate states, as well as custom render props, it offers a wide range of
design possibilities and use cases.
