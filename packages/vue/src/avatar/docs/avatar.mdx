</template>
```

## Handling Events

Avatar also provides `@error` and `@load` events that can be utilized to handle
situations when the image fails to load or has finished loading:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Avatar, AvatarFallback, AvatarImage } from '@ark-ui/vue'
</script>
<template>
  <Avatar
    @error="() => console.log('error')"
    @load="() => console.log('loaded')"
  >
    <AvatarFallback>PA</AvatarFallback>
    <AvatarImage src="https://i.pravatar.cc/300" alt="avatar" />
  </Avatar>
</template>
```

## Conclusion

The Avatar component provides an efficient way to display user or entity
representation within your applications. Its simple yet flexible structure
allows it to easily fit within various use cases and design needs.
