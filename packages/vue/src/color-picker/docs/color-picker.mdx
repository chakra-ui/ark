## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```ts
import {
  ColorPicker,
  ColorPickerArea,
  ColorPickerAreaGradient,
  ColorPickerAreaThumb,
  ColorPickerChannelInput,
  ColorPickerContent,
  ColorPickerEyeDropperTrigger,
  ColorPickerSliderThumb,
  ColorPickerSliderTrack,
  ColorPickerSwatch,
  ColorPickerSwatchGroup,
} from '@ark-ui/vue'
```

Here is an example of how to use the Color Picker component:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
import {
  ColorPicker,
  ColorPickerArea,
  ColorPickerAreaGradient,
  ColorPickerAreaThumb,
  ColorPickerChannelInput,
  ColorPickerContent,
  type ColorPickerContext,
  ColorPickerEyeDropperTrigger,
  ColorPickerSliderThumb,
  ColorPickerSliderTrack,
  ColorPickerSwatch,
  ColorPickerSwatchGroup,
} from '@ark-ui/vue'

const colorPickerValue = ref('hsl(10, 81%, 59%)')
</script>
<template>
  <ColorPicker
    v-model="colorPickerValue"
    v-slot="{
      channels: [hue, saturation, lightness],
      value,
    }: ColorPickerContext"
  >
    <ColorPickerContent>
      <output>
        <div>Color: {{ value }}</div>
      </output>
      <ColorPickerArea :xChannel="saturation" :yChannel="lightness">
        <ColorPickerAreaGradient />
        <ColorPickerAreaThumb />
      </ColorPickerArea>

      <ColorPickerSwatch :value="value" readOnly />

      <ColorPickerSliderTrack :channel="hue">
        <ColorPickerSliderThumb />
      </ColorPickerSliderTrack>

      <ColorPickerSliderTrack channel="alpha">
        <ColorPickerSliderThumb />
      </ColorPickerSliderTrack>

      <ColorPickerChannelInput :channel="hue" />
      <ColorPickerChannelInput :channel="saturation" />
      <ColorPickerChannelInput :channel="lightness" />

      <ColorPickerChannelInput channel="alpha" />
      <ColorPickerChannelInput channel="hex" />

      <ColorPickerSwatchGroup>
        <ColorPickerSwatch value="#123123" />
        <ColorPickerSwatch value="#ff1321" />
      </ColorPickerSwatchGroup>

      <ColorPickerEyeDropperTrigger>
        <button>Pick color</button>
      </ColorPickerEyeDropperTrigger>
    </ColorPickerContent>
  </ColorPicker>
</template>
```

## Uncontrolled Component

In the uncontrolled use case, you don't need to manage the state of the Color
Picker component. Instead, you can provide a defaultValue prop to set the
initial value, and use the onChange and onChangeEnd event handlers to get the
selected color:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { ColorPicker } from '@ark-ui/vue'

const colorPickerValue = ref('#ff0000')

const handleColorChange = (details) => {
  console.log('Color changed:', details.value)
}

const handleColorChangeEnd = (details) => {
  console.log('Color change ended:', details.value)
}
</script>
<template>
  <ColorPicker
    v-model="colorPickerValue"
    @change="handleColorChange"
    @change-end="handleColorChangeEnd"
  >
    <!-- ... -->
  </ColorPicker>
</template>
```

## Controlled Component

In the controlled use case, you can manage the state of the Color Picker
component through the `v-model`:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { ColorPicker } from '@ark-ui/vue'

const colorPickerValue = ref('#ff0000')
</script>
<template>
  <ColorPicker v-model="colorPickerValue">
    <!-- ... -->
  </ColorPicker>
</template>
```

## Conclusion

The Color Picker component offers a flexible and powerful solution for
integrating color selection into your applications. With its comprehensive set
of features and customizability, it can accommodate a wide range of use cases
and designs.
