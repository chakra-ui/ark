## [4.0.1] - 2024-09-26

### Fixed

- Corrected an issue where Vue 3.5.x was not properly declared as a peer dependency.

## [4.0.0] - 2024-09-25

In this major release, we shifted from primitive data types like strings to more structured types
such as Collection, Color, and DateValue. This enhanced flexibility and control by offering advanced
methods and properties.

The new APIs introduced helper functions like `parseColor`, `parseDate`, and `createListCollection`
to simplify working with the new types and make code more concise.

### Changed

- Ark UI Vue now required Vue 3.5.x or later, as it leveraged the useId() helper introduced in this
  version.
- **ColorPicker [Breaking]**: Updated `value` and `defaultValue` types from `string` to `Color`. Use
  the exported `parseColor` function to convert between strings and color objects.

  **Before**

  ```tsx
  import { ColorPicker } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'

  const Demo = () => {
    return <ColorPicker.Root defaultValue="#000" />
  }
  ```

  **After**

  ```tsx
  import { ColorPicker, parseColor } from '@ark-ui/react/color-picker'

  const Demo = () => {
    return <ColorPicker.Root defaultValue={parseColor('#000')} />
  }
  ```

  > This change allows direct access to color object methods and properties.

- **Select, Combobox [Breaking]**: Removed the `items`, `itemToString`, and `itemToValue` props.
  Introduced a `collection` prop instead. Use the `createListCollection` helper to generate a
  collection from items.

  **Before**

  ```tsx
  import { Select } from '@ark-ui/react/select'

  const Demo = () => {
    return <Select.Root items={['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3']} />
  }
  ```

  **After**

  ```tsx
  import { Select, createListCollection } from '@ark-ui/react/select'

  const collection = createListCollection({
    items: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3'],
  })

  const Demo = () => {
    return <Select.Root collection={collection} />
  }
  ```

- **DatePicker [Breaking]**: Changed `value` and `defaultValue` types from `string` to `Date`. To
  convert between strings and dates, use the `parseDate` function.

  **Before**

  ```tsx
  import { DatePicker } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'

  const Demo = () => {
    return <DatePicker.Root defaultValue="2024-01-01" />
  }
  ```

  **After**

  ```tsx
  import { DatePicker, parseDate } from '@ark-ui/react/date-picker'

  const Demo = () => {
    return <DatePicker.Root defaultValue={parseDate('2024-01-01')} />
  }
  ```

### Added

- **FileUpload**: Add support for more file types in file upload `accept` intellisense

  title: 'Uploaded successfully',
  type: 'success',
  action: {
    label: 'Undo',
    onClick: () => {
      console.log('undo')
    },
  },
})
```

- **File Upload**: Added support for `invalid` prop in file upload to explicitly mark upload

### Highlights

We are excited to announce the first major release of Ark UI Vue! Ark UI Vue is now feature-complete
and ready for production use.

To maintain consistency across our suite, we have aligned the versioning of all Ark UI packages.
Therefore, the next release of Ark UI Vue will be v3.

This update introduces several new components, enhancements, and bug fixes. Here are some of the
highlights:

### Added

- **Context Components**: Introduced the `Context` component for easier access to internal machine
  APIs, improving component composition. See the example below:

```vue
<template>
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger>Open</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner>
      <Popover.Context v-slot="popover">
        <Popover.Content>
          <Popover.Title @click="popover.setOpen(false)">Title</Popover.Title>
          <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
        </Popover.Content>
      </Popover.Context>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
</template>
```

- **Format**: Added a `Format` component for formatting bytes and numbers.

```vue
<Format.Byte :value="120904" unit="byte" unit-display="short" />
<Format.Number :value="1204" unit="centimeter" />
```

- **Tooltip**: Added `defaultOpen` prop for cases where you do not need to control its open state.
- **Types**: Exported `Assign` and `Optional` types to enhance type handling.
- **Toast**: Added support for overlapping and stacked toast.

### Changed

- **[BREAKING]**: Exposed hidden inputs in `Checkbox`, `ColorPicker`, `FileUpload`, `PinInput`,
  `RadioGroup`, `RatingGroup`, `SegmentGroup`, `Select`, `Slider`, `Switch`, and `TagsInput` for
  better form library compatibility. Please ensure to include the hidden input in your component as
  shown below:

```jsx
<Checkbox.Root>
  <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
  <Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Indicator>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput /> <!-- [!code highlight] -->
</Checkbox.Root>
```

- **[BREAKING] Combobox, Select**: Made `id` optional and removed `htmlFor` from `ItemGroupLabel`
  for cleaner markup.

```diff
- <Combobox.ItemGroup id="framework">
-   <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel htmlFor="framework">Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
+ <Combobox.ItemGroup>
+   <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
```

- **[BREAKING] Popover, Tooltip**: Renamed `closeOnEsc` to `closeOnEscape` to be consistent with
  dialog machine.
- **[BREAKING] Combobox, Menu, Select, Tabs, ToggleGroup**: Renamed `loop` to `focusLopp` to be more
  descriptive.

  providers.

### Fixed

- **Accordion**: Fixed initial flicker of content.
- **TagsInput**: Replaced `HTMLInputElement` with `HTMLDivElement` in `TagsInput.Root`.

### Removed

- **[BREAKING]**: Dropped direct internal API access from Root components. Use the new `Context`
  component for more flexible and cleaner API integration.
- **[BREAKING]**: Simplified component APIs by removing `dir` and `getRootNode` attributes. Use
  [LocaleProvider](https://ark-ui.com/vue/docs/providers/environment) and
  [EnvironmentProvider](https://ark-ui.com/vue/docs/providers/locale) for these settings.

## [0.11.0] - 2024-02-08

```

- **Breaking Change**: Removed the `.Root` suffix for provider component like `Presence` and
  `Environment`.

- <Presence.Root>...</Presence.Root>
+ <Presence>...</Presence>
```

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the `indicator` part to `view` in the `Progress` component to more
  accurately reflect its functionality.

- Added the `ItemPreview` component to the `TagsInput` component. See the example below:

```diff
<TagsInput.Item key={index} index={index} value={value}>
+  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>Delete</TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
+ </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
</TagsInput.Item>

  paragraphs.

- Fixed an issue on touch devices where selecting an item within `Combobox`, `Menu`, or `Select`
  triggered a click event on the element behind the portalled content.

  `AccordionContent`, `ComboboxContent`, `DialogBackdrop`, `DialogContent`, `HoverCardContent`,
  `MenuContent`, `PopoverContent`, `SelectContent`, and `TooltipContent` components. The `lazyMount`
  property allows for on-demand rendering of content, while the `unmountOnExit` property enables the
  removal of the component from the DOM once it's no longer required, ensuring better resource
  management and cleaner code.

## [0.5.2] - 2023-06-27

### Added

- Support for standalone component imports: Developers can now import individual components, such as
  `@ark-ui/vue/tabs` instead of the full `@ark-ui/vue` package. This is a significant feature for
  those working with bundlers that do not support tree-shaking. By allowing imports of individual
  components, we ensure a reduced bundle size when the full package import is not necessary.
