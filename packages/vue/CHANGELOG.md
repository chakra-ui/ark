## [5.0.1] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! 🚀

### What’s new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** – Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** – Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using Vue's native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x–4x** better performance across the board.

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(ComponentUnderTest, {
    props: {
      defaultOpen: true,
    },
  })
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(ComponentUnderTest, {
    props: {
      defaultOpen: true,
    },
  })
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```
