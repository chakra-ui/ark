  Ark Components effectively.

## Install Ark UI

To start using Ark UI, you need to install it in your project. You can do so
using yarn, npm, or pnpm by running one of the following commands in your
terminal:

```bash
yarn add @ark-ui/vue
## or
npm install @ark-ui/vue
## or
pnpm add @ark-ui/vue
```

## Creating a Slider Component

Once Ark UI is installed, you can start creating UI components. Below, we'll
demonstrate how to create a `Slider` component using Ark UI.

### Step 1: Import the Components

Every component in Ark UI is modular, meaning that each part of a component can
be imported and used independently. Below is an example of how to import and use
the different parts of the `Slider` component:

```jsx
import {
  Slider,
  SliderLabel,
  SliderControl,
  SliderThumb,
  SliderTrack,
  SliderRange,
} from '@ark-ui/vue'

export const MySlider = () => (
  <Slider>
    <SliderLabel>Label</SliderLabel>
    <SliderControl>
      <SliderTrack>
        <SliderRange />
      </SliderTrack>
      <SliderThumb />
    </SliderControl>
  </Slider>
)
```

### Step 2: Style Your Slider Component

While Ark UI is a headless UI library, it provides you with several flexible
ways to style your components to suit your application's aesthetics.

Ark UI assigns a `data-scope` and `data-part` attribute to every component part,
allowing you to use CSS selectors to target specific parts of a component.
Here's an example showing how to add styles to the `Slider` component:

```css
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='thumb'] {
  background: blue;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  border-radius: 999px;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='track'] {
  background: silver;
  height: 8px;
  flex: 1;
}

[data-scope='slider'][data-part='control'] {
  position: relative;
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
}
```

It's worth noting that Ark UI doesn't limit you to using CSS selectors. You can
also use class names, inline styles, or even the `asChild` prop for greater
customization and control over your components. These styling approaches make
Ark UI compatible with any styling solution, and they enable you to integrate
Ark UI with existing UI libraries seamlessly.

To learn more about how to style components in Ark UI, refer to the
comprehensive [Styling Components guide](/docs/vue/overview/styling) in our
documentation.
