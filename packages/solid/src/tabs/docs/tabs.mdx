## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Tabs,
  TabList,
  TabTrigger,
  TabContent,
  TabIndicator,
} from '@ark-ui/solid'
```

Here are some examples of how to use the Tabs component:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Initial Tab

To set a default tab on initial render, use the `value` prop:

<Story name="InitialTab" />

## Tab Indicator

To provide a visual cue for the selected tab, use the `TabIndicator` component:

<Story name="Indicator" />

## Disabled Tab

To disable a tab, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `TabTrigger` component:

<Story name="DisabledTab" />

## Controlled Tabs

To create a controlled Tabs component, manage the current selected tab using the
`value` prop and update it when the `onChange` event handler is called:

<Story name="Controlled" />

## Vertical Tabs

The default orientation of the tabs is `horizontal`. To change the orientation,
set the `orientation` prop to `vertical`.

<Story name="Vertical" />

## Manual Activation

By default, the tab can be selected when it receives focus from either the
keyboard or pointer interaction. This is called automatic tab activation.

In contrast, manual tab activation means the tab is selected with the

<kbd>Enter</kbd> key or by clicking on the tab.

<Story name="Manual" />

## Conclusion

The Tabs component offers a comprehensive and flexible solution for adding
tabbed navigation to your applications. With a wide variety of customization
options and features, it can accommodate various use cases and designs.
