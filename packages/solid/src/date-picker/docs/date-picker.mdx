description:
  The Date Picker is a comprehensive tool for date selection within your
  application. It supports various view modes (day, month, year), single date
  selection, and range selection. This component also allows the rendering of
  multiple grids for a broader date range view.
---

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  DatePicker,
  DatePickerControl,
  DatePickerInput,
  DatePickerTrigger,
  DatePickerClearTrigger,
  DatePickerContent,
  DatePickerYearSelect,
  DatePickerMonthSelect,
  DatePickerPrevTrigger,
  DatePickerViewTrigger,
  DatePickerNextTrigger,
  DatePickerGrid,
  DatePickerRowHeader,
  DatePickerColumnHeader,
  DatePickerRowGroup,
  DatePickerRow,
  DatePickerDayCell,
  DatePickerDayCellTrigger,
  DatePickerMonthCell,
  DatePickerMonthCellTrigger,
  DatePickerYearCell,
  DatePickerYearCellTrigger,
} from '@ark-ui/solid'
```

Here is an example of how to use the Date Picker component:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Range Selection with Single Grid

To create a Date Picker that allows a range selection, set the `selectionMode`
prop to "range". This renders a single grid view where the user can select a
start and end date:

<Story name="RangeWithSingleGrid" />

## Range Selection with Two Grids

In some cases, you might want to display two consecutive months at the same time
to facilitate a broader range selection. This can be achieved by setting the
`numOfMonths` prop to `2`:

<Story name="RangeWithTwoGrids" />

## Conclusion

The Date Picker component provides a versatile solution for date selection needs
in your applications. With support for different view modes, single and range
date selection, and the ability to render multiple grids, it offers a wide range
of customization and usability options.
