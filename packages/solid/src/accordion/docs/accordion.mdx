## Import

```ts
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionTrigger,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionContent,
} from '@ark-ui/solid'
```

## Usage

The Accordion component consists of the `Accordion`, `AccordionTrigger`,
`AccordionItem` and `AccordionContent` components.

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 1 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 1 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 2 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 2 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Allow toggling the open state

To collapse an already expanded accordion item by clicking on it, set the
`collapsible` prop property to `true`.

If `multiple` is `true`, we internally set collapsible to be true.

```tsx
<Accordion collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 1 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 1 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 2 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 2 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Allow multiple open accordions at once

To allow multiple items to be expanded at once, set `multiple` to `true`. This
mode implicitly sets `collapsible` to `true` and ensures that each accordion can
be expanded.

```tsx
<Accordion multiple>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 1 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 1 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 2 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 2 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Disable specific accordion items

To disable a specific accordion item, set the `disabled` prop to `true`. When an
accordion item is disabled, it is skipped from keyboard navigation and can't be
interacted with.

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="panel-1" disabled>
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 1 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 1 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="panel-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <button>Panel 2 trigger</button>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>Panel 2 content</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### Listening to changes with onChange

The accordion item accepts a `onChange` prop to listen for change events. The
`onChange` prop is called with the details of the accordion item that was
selected.

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js'

const Controlled = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = createSignal<string | string[] | null>('panel-2')
  return (
    <Accordion value={value()} onChange={(details) => setValue(details.value)}>
      {['panel-1', 'panel-2', 'panel-3'].map((id) => (
        <AccordionItem value={id}>
          <AccordionTrigger>
            <button>{id} trigger</button>
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>{id} content</AccordionContent>
        </AccordionItem>
      ))}
    </Accordion>
  )
}
```
