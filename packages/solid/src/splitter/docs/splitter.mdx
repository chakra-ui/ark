description:
  The Splitter is a flexible and dynamic component that allows division of the
  screen or a section into multiple resizable areas.
---

## Getting Started

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import { Splitter, SplitterPanel, SplitterResizeTrigger } from '@ark-ui/solid'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Using Render Props

The Splitter component allows you to pass a function as a child to gain direct
access to its API. This provides more control and allows you to modify the size
of the panels programmatically:

<Story name="RenderProp" />

## Handling Events

Splitter also provides `onResizeStart` and `onResizeEnd` events which can be
useful to perform some actions during the start and end of the resizing process:

<Story name="Events" />

## Vertical Splitter

By default, the Splitter component is horizontal. If you need a vertical
splitter, use the `orientation` prop:

<Story name="Vertical" />

## Conclusion

The Splitter component provides an intuitive way to divide your user interface
into multiple resizable sections. With the use of its API, event handlers, and
props, you can achieve a high level of control and customization, accommodating
a wide range of design and functionality needs.
