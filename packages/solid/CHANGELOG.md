### Highlights

The 3.0 release brings significant enhancements and some breaking changes for a more streamlined and
flexible API. Key updates include new components and types, improved form integration, and enhanced
forward compatibility. Here are some highlights:

### Added

- **Context Components:** Introduced the `Context` component for easier access to internal machine
  APIs, improving component composition. See the example below:

```tsx
export const Basic = () => (
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger>Open</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Positioner>
      <Popover.Context>
        {(popover) => (
          <Popover.Content>
            <Popover.Title onClick={() => popover().setOpen(false)}>Title</Popover.Title>
            <Popover.Description>Description</Popover.Description>
          </Popover.Content>
        )}
      </Popover.Context>
    </Popover.Positioner>
  </Popover.Root>
)
```

- **Format:** Added a `Format` component for formatting bytes and numbers.

```tsx
<Format.Byte value={120904} unit="byte" unitDisplay="short" />
<Format.Number value={1204} unit="centimeter" />
```

- **Tooltip:** Added `defaultOpen` prop for cases where you do not need to control its open state.
- **Types:** Exported `Assign` and `Optional` types to enhance type handling.
- **Toast:** Added support for overlapping and stacked toast.

### Changed

- **[BREAKING]:** Exposed hidden inputs in `Checkbox`, `ColorPicker`, `FileUpload`, `PinInput`,
  `RadioGroup`, `RatingGroup`, `SegmentGroup`, `Select`, `Slider`, `Switch`, and `TagsInput` for
  better form library compatibility. Please ensure to include the hidden input in your component
  like shown below:

```tsx
<Checkbox.Root>
  <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox</Checkbox.Label>
  <Checkbox.Control>
    <Checkbox.Indicator>
      <CheckIcon />
    </Checkbox.Indicator>
  </Checkbox.Control>
  <Checkbox.HiddenInput /> // [!code highlight]
</Checkbox.Root>
```

- **[BREAKING]:** Made `id` optional and removed `for` from `ItemGroupLabel` in `Combobox` and
  `Select` for cleaner markup.

```diff
- <Combobox.ItemGroup id="framework">
-   <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel for="framework">Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
+ <Combobox.ItemGroup>
+   <Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>Frameworks</Combobox.ItemGroupLabel>
```

- **[BREAKING] Popover, Tooltip:** Renamed `closeOnEsc` to `closeOnEscape` to be consistent with
  dialog machine.
- **[BREAKING] Combobox, Menu, Select, Tabs, ToggleGroup:** Renamed `loop` to `focusLopp` to be more
  descriptive.
- **[BREAKING]:** Renamed `Environment` to `EnvironmentProvider` to align with other providers.
- Refined the `as` prop implementation for improved type merging and performance.

```tsx
// before
<Button as={Dialog.Trigger} variant="solid" size="sm">
  Open Dialog
</Button>

// after
<Dialog.Trigger asChild={(props) => <Button {...props()} />}>
  Open Dialog
</Dialog.Trigger>
```

### Fixed

- **DatePicker:** Resolved issues with `min` and `max` props not supporting date strings.
- **Accordion:** Fixed initial flicker of content.
- **TagsInput:** Replaced `HTMLInputElement` with `HTMLDivElement` in `TagsInput.Root`.
- **Select, Combobox:** Fixed an issue with reactivity.
- **Toast:** Resolved an issue with `Toast` not updating its toasts and count properties when
  creating one or more toasts.
- **ColorPicker:** Added missing `HTMLArkProps<'div'>` to `ColorPicker.View`.

### Removed

- **[BREAKING]:** Dropped direct internal API access from Root components. Use the new `Context`
  component for more flexible and cleaner API integration.
- **[BREAKING]:** Simplified component APIs by removing `dir` and `getRootNode` attributes. Use
  [LocaleProvider](https://ark-ui.com/solid/docs/providers/environment) and
  [EnvironmentProvider](https://ark-ui.com/solid/docs/providers/locale) for these settings.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-02-27

### Added

- Added `Collapsible` component.
- Added new `FormatByte` and `FormatNumber` components.

### Changed

- Enhanced the performance of the Ark `factory` by utilizing `memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Integrated `Collapsible` into `Accordion`, allowing the `Accordion` component to utilize
  `Collapsible` for animating the opening and closing of content.d

```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    height: 0;
  }
  to {
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    height: 0;
  }
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: slideDown 250ms;
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: slideUp 200ms;
}
```

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the disabled `Tooltip` would flash upon hovering and clicking the trigger.
- Fixed an issue where a disclosure components could not be initially set to an open state without
  being controlled.

## [2.1.1] - 2024-02-16

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue where the `Clipboard` component was not exported correctly.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-02-14

### Added

- Introduced `Clipboard` component. Refer to the
  [documentation](https://ark-ui.com/docs/components/clipboard) for details.

  `HoverCard`, `Menu`, `Popover`, `Select`, and `Tooltip`.
- Exported `SelectionDetails` type for the `Menu` component.
- Added a `PresetTrigger` part to the `DatePicker` component, enabling custom triggers for common
  date presets (e.g., Last 7 days, Last 30 days).

  `index` attribute to `DatePicker.Input`. Example usage:

```jsx
<DatePicker.Control>
  <DatePicker.Input index={0} />
  <DatePicker.Input index={1} />
</DatePicker.Control>
```

### Changed

- Refined the `TreeView` component API for streamlined component usage. See the
  [documentation](https://ark-ui.com/docs/components/tree-view) for details.
- Updated `Dialog.Description` and `Popover.Description` elements from `p` to `div` for better
  paragraph handling.
- Altered `TreeView.BranchTrigger` element from `button` to `div` for accessibility enhancements.

### Fixed

- Addressed an issue where positioned components failed to adjust to window resizing.
- Corrected a behavior where restoring scroll position triggered a smooth scroll effect back to the
  starting point.
- Rectified a problem in `Combobox`, `Menu`, and `Select` where scrolling into view inadvertently
  scrolled the body element.
- Fixed a discrepancy in `DatePicker` regarding the incorrect display of weeks when setting
  `startOfWeek`.

### Added

- Added `TreeView` component
- Updated `@zag-js` dependencies to their latest versions, enhancing performance for all components.

### Changed

  element or a custom component. For example:

```diff
- <Popover.Trigger asChild><Button>Open</Button></Popover.Trigger>
+ <Popover.Trigger as={<Button>Open</Button>} />
```

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the root types for all components to `<ComponentName>RootProps`. Like
  shown for the `Avatar` component below:

```diff
- import type { AvatarProps } from "@ark-ui/solid"
+ import type { AvatarRootProps } from "@ark-ui/solid"
```

- **Breaking Change**: Removed the `.Root` suffix for provider component like `Presence` and
  `Environment`.

```diff
- <Presence.Root>...</Presence.Root>
+ <Presence>...</Presence>
```

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed the `indicator` part to `view` in the `Progress` component to more
  accurately reflect its functionality.

- Added the `ItemPreview` component to the `TagsInput` component. See the example below:

```diff
<TagsInput.Item index={index} value={value()}>
+  <TagsInput.ItemPreview>
    <TagsInput.ItemText>{value}</TagsInput.ItemText>
    <TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>Delete</TagsInput.ItemDeleteTrigger>
+ </TagsInput.ItemPreview>
  <TagsInput.ItemInput />
</TagsInput.Item>
```

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue on touch devices where selecting an item within `Combobox`, `Menu`, or `Select`
  triggered a click event on the element behind the portalled content.
- Fixed an issue in `PinInput` where pasting a value filled all inputs instead of populating them
  one per input.

  placement: 'top-end',
  render(toast) {
    return (
      <Toast.Root>
        <Toast.Title>{toast.title}</Toast.Title>

## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-09

We are happy to announce the release of `@ark-ui/solid@1.0.0`. This release includes a number of
breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes. Since our last release over two months ago, we will
only highlight some key changes. Please refer to the documentation for each component to learn more.

  level. For some disclosure components like `Tabs` and `Accordion`, this constitutes a breaking
  change.
- Breaking changes have been implemented in `Accordion`, `ColorPicker`, `DatePicker`, `Dialog`,
  `RadioGroup`, `SegmentGroup`, `TagsInput`, `Toast`, and `ToggleGroup` to achieve a consistent and
  more intuitive API.
- Resolved various bugs and addressed accessibility issues across all components.

### Stability and Support

With the release of version 1.0.0, we are moving towards a more stable version of `@ark-ui/solid`.
Future updates will strive to avoid breaking changes, ensuring a smoother experience for our users.
If you encounter any issues while upgrading, please do not hesitate to open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/issues). Your feedback is invaluable in helping
us improve.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-08

### Added

- To improve performance and reduce initial load times, we've introduced two new properties to the
  `AccordionContent`, `ComboboxContent`, `DialogBackdrop`, `DialogContent`, `HoverCardContent`,
  `MenuContent`, `PopoverContent`, `SelectContent`, and `TooltipContent` components. The `lazyMount`
  property allows for on-demand rendering of content, while the `unmountOnExit` property enables the
  removal of the component from the DOM once it's no longer required, ensuring better resource
  management and cleaner code.
