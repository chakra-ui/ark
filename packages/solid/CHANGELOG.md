  async function fetchImage() {
    const response = await fetch('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
    return response.blob()
  }

  return (
    <DownloadTrigger data={fetchImage} fileName="avatar.jpeg" mimeType="image/jpeg">

}
```

    onValueChange: (e) => setValue(e.value),
  }))

## [5.0.0] - 2025-03-06

Ark UI just got a major performance boost! üöÄ

### What‚Äôs new in v5?

- **Blazing-fast performance** ‚Äì Every component runs smoother and renders faster.
- **Smaller bundle size** ‚Äì Leaner components and adapters for a more efficient build.

We made this happen by using Solid's native reactive primitives instead of external stores.

In our stress tests with **10,000 components**, Ark v5 delivered **1.5x‚Äì4x** better performance across the board.

### A quick note on tests

Most component updates are non-breaking, but due to this change, some tests may need adjustments. For example:

```jsx
// Before
it('should open by default', () => {
  render(() => <ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// After
it('should open by default', async () => {
  render(() => <ComponentUnderTest defaultOpen />)
  expect(await screen.findByRole('dialog')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```
