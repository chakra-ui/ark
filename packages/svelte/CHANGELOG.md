## [Unreleased]

## [5.3.3] - 2025-08-01

### Fixed

- **Carousel**: Fix issue where controlled carousel ignores last slide

## [5.3.2] - 2025-07-26

### Fixed

- **Dialog**
  - Sync content `--layer-index` with positioner and backdrop
  - Decouple `trapFocus` from `modal` so it's possible to set `modal=false` and `trapFocus=true`

## [5.3.1] - 2025-07-23

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fixed issue where hovered range was connect to selected values, when it shouldn't

- **Tree View**: Fixed issue where tree view doesn't scroll into view when content overflows.

- **Portal**: Fix issue in SvelteKit where `Portal` component doesn't work as expected.

## [5.3.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- **Collection**: Add `useListSelection` function for managing collection item selection with support for
  single/multiple selection modes

  ```js
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'] })
  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('Svelte')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('Svelte')
  selection.toggle('Angular')
  ```

- **File Upload**: Add support for `bind:acceptedFiles` and `defaultAcceptedFiles` to programmatically control the
  accepted files

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for `bind:paths` and `defaultPaths` to programmatically control the paths

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fix date comparison issues when time components are involved. This resolves critical issues with date
  comparison operations when different date types (`CalendarDate`, `CalendarDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`) are mixed,
  particularly in scenarios involving time components.

## [5.2.0] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- **Checkbox**: Add `CheckboxGroupProvider` component for external checkbox group state management

### Fixed

- **Carousel**: Fix issue where full page carousel could trap scrolling

- **ListCollection**: Export `UseListCollectionReturn` type

- **TreeCollection**: Fix issue where the `filter` method completely deletes the children key from the node when there
  are no matching children

- **Number Input**: Fix issue where default pattern does not allow negative numbers with decimal point

- **File Upload**
  - Export `FileError`, `FileMimeType`, and `FileRejection` types
  - Fix issue where calling `api.setFiles` invokes validation with incorrect `acceptedFiles`
  - Fix issue where the browser might not be able to infer the mime type of a file due to limitations, drag source or
    security restrictions. As a fallback in the file validation logic, we now infer the mime type from the file
    extension.

- **Portal**: Fix issue where `lifecycle_double_unmount` warning could be triggered.

## [5.0.5] - 2025-06-28

### Fixed

- Fix issue where `bind:ref` doesn't work with components, making it impossible to access the underlying DOM element.
  Now, you can pass `bind:ref` to all components.

  ```svelte
  <script lang="ts">
    let rootNode = $state<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)

    $inspect(rootNode)
  </script>

  <Accordion.Root bind:ref={rootNode}>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Trigger>Item 1</Accordion.Trigger>
      <Accordion.Content>Content 1</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
  ```
