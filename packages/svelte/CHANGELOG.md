## [Unreleased]

## [5.12.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- **Marquee** [New]: Initial release of marquee component for continuously scrolling content

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Resolved an issue where dragging the thumb from non-center positions caused unexpected value jumps.
  The thumb now maintains consistent positioning relative to the initial click point.

- **Slider**: Fixed a problem where the thumb offset shifted dynamically during dragging, resulting in value jumps. The
  offset now remains constant from the pointer throughout the drag operation.

- **Svelte**: Refactored `mergeProps` to return class values as arrays, delegating resolution to Svelte's native class
  handling for improved support of conditional classes and objects.

- **Date Picker**: Resolved a crash in the range date picker occurring when users typed the end date first by
  implementing `null`/`undefined` checks for date property access.

- **Radio Group**: Reverted to `offsetLeft`/`offsetTop` calculations to restore correct indicator positioning within
  scrollable container contexts.

- **Tabs**: Reverted to `offsetLeft`/`offsetTop` calculations to fix indicator positioning issues in scrollable
  containers.

- **Tour**:
  - Corrected improper effect cleanup procedures
  - Fixed wait step functionality
  - Added step validation on mount to verify configuration validity

## [5.11.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- **Angle Slider**: Fix accessibility violation where the slider thumb element lacked an accessible name. The thumb now
  supports `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props, and automatically falls back to the label element's ID for proper
  ARIA labeling.

- **Select**: Fix accessibility violation where the required state was not set correctly to on the trigger.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where entering a custom tag with combobox integration required pressing `Enter` twice. The
  tags-input now correctly handles custom values when the combobox has no highlighted item (`aria-activedescendant` is
  empty), allowing the tag to be added on the first `Enter` press.

## [5.11.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed

- **Checkbox**
  - Fix issue where setting initial checked state to `indeterminate` doesn't work
  - Ensure `api.checkedState` returns the correct checked state (`boolean | "indeterminate"`)

- **Collapsible**: Fix issue where `dir` prop value was hardcoded to `ltr` instead of using the provided value

- **Combobox**: Fix issue where controlled single-select combobox does not propagate its initial value to `inputValue`

- **Listbox**: Fix issue where pressing Enter key when no highlighted item still calls `event.preventDefault()`

- **Radio Group**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Slider**
  - Fix issue where slider could stop abruptly when scrubbing thumb
  - Fix issue where range slider thumbs become stuck when dragged to the same position without `minStepsBetweenThumbs`

- **Tabs**: Refactor to use `getBoundingClientRect()` for precise indicator positioning

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where `maxLength` doesn't apply to the edit input as well

## [5.11.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Collapsible**: Add support for `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth` props to control the dimensions of the
  collapsible content when in its collapsed state.

- **Focus Trap**: Allow elements referenced by `aria-controls` to be included in the trap scope. This makes it possible
  for menus, popovers, etc. to be portalled and work correctly.

- **Pagination**: Add `getPageUrl` prop for generating `href` attributes when using pagination as links.

```ts
const service = useMachine(pagination.machine, {
  type: 'link',
  getPageUrl: ({ page, pageSize }) => `/products?page=${page}&size=${pageSize}`,
})
```

- **Select**: Add `SelectRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.

- **TreeView**:
  - Add `TreeViewRootComponentProps` type export for better component type composition.
  - (Experimental) Add support for node renaming functionality:
    - Add `TreeViewNodeRenameInput` component for inline node label editing
    - Add `canRename` prop to control which nodes can be renamed
    - Add `onRenameStart`, `onBeforeRename`, and `onRenameComplete` callbacks for rename lifecycle
    - Add `CheckedChangeDetails`, `LoadChildrenErrorDetails`, `RenameStartDetails`, and `RenameCompleteDetails` type
      exports

### Fixed

- **Select**: Fix issue where `Select.HiddenSelect` doesn't emit correct values when using custom objects with
  `itemToValue`

- **Field**: Fix issue where `bind:value` doesn't work correctly in `Field.Textarea`, `Field.Input`, and `Field.Select`
  components

- **Password Input**: Fix issue where `bind:value` doesn't work correctly in `PasswordInput.Input` component

- **Scroll Area**: Fix RTL horizontal scrollbar positioning on Safari

- **Slider**: Fix issue where slider continues dragging when disabled during drag operation.

- **Switch**: Fix issue where `data-active` is inconsistently applied when `disabled` state changes at runtime

- **Presence**: Fix issue where exit animations don't work on subsequent toggles when using `lazyMount` and
  `unmountOnExit` together

## [5.10.1] - 2025-09-27

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Fix issue where year range picker doesn't show the hovered range
  - Fix issue where quarter presets returns incorrect date

- **FormatByte**: Add support for `unitSystem` property to allow changing between decimal (1000 bytes) and binary (1024
  bytes) systems.

- **Number Input**: When `formatOptions` is used (like `style: "currency"`), the cursor would jump to the end of the
  input when typing in the middle. The cursor now maintains its relative position during formatting changes.

- **Pin Input**: Fix issue where using the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` to delete text in pin
  inputs would insert "undefined" instead of clearing the field.

- **Scroll Area**: Fix issue where resize tracking was not observing the root element, which caused the scrollbar to not
  update when the root element's size changed.

- **Select**: Fix inconsistent `lazyMount`/`unmountOnExit` behavior where the positioner remained in the DOM when the
  component was closed, while the content was correctly unmounted.

- **Exports**: Fix issue where Node.js programs like PandaCSS were not able to resolve the `@ark-ui/svelte/anatomy`
  entrypoint due to the missing `default` condition

## [5.10.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added

- Added `mergeProps` utility for combining multiple props objects with proper event handler and className merging.
- Added `createContext` utility for creating typed React contexts with improved DX.

```tsx
import { createContext } from '@ark-ui/solid/utils'
```

## [5.9.1] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

- **General**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` throws when `props` is `undefined` or `null`

## [5.9.0] - 2025-09-14

### Removed

- **TimePicker**: The TimePicker component has been removed from this release. This component was never part of the
  public API and was considered experimental. It had significant bugs and usability issues across all frameworks and
  locales, making it unsuitable for production use.

  **Migration**: We recommend building a custom time picker using the Select component for simple use cases, or
  implementing a time grid pattern for more complex scenarios.

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `alwaysSubmitOnEnter` prop to allow bypassing the default two-step behavior (Enter to close
  combobox, then Enter to submit form) and instead submit the form immediately on Enter press. This is useful for
  single-field autocomplete forms where Enter should submit the form directly.

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Changed

- **Hover Card**: Change default delay values for hover card to improve accessibility.
  - `openDelay`: from `700ms` to `600ms`

- **Tooltip**: Change default delay values for tooltip to improve accessibility.
  [Learn more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/timing-exposing-content)
  - `openDelay`: from `1000ms` to `400ms`
  - `closeDelay`: from `500ms` to `150ms`

### Fixed

- **Editable**: Allow text selection in editable preview when `autoResize` is enabled

  Previously, when `autoResize` was set to `true`, the preview element had `userSelect: "none"` applied, preventing
  users from selecting text. This has been fixed by removing the `userSelect` style property.

- **File Upload**: Fix regression where clicking the trigger doesn't open the file picker when used within the dropzone

- **Svelte**: Fix Svelte warning about state reference capturing initial value instead of current reactive state

- **Menu**
  - Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view
  - Fix issue where keyboard activation of menu items with `target="_blank"` would open two tabs

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

## [5.8.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- **Field**: Add `data-required` attribute to `Field.Label`
- **Select, Combobox, Listbox, TreeView**: Export `RootComponent` and `RootProviderComponent` types which are useful
  when building compositions that wrap the `Root` and `RootProvider` components and you still want type-safety for the
  collection.

### Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix `Menu.ItemText` not working inside `Menu.TriggerItem`

## [5.7.0] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- **Combobox**: Add `ComboboxEmpty` component to display content when the combobox has no items

- **Listbox**: Add `ListboxEmpty` component to display content when the listbox has no items

- **Hover Card**: Add support for `disabled` prop

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Fix issue where disabled items could be reached via typeahead

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [5.6.0] - 2025-08-24

### Added

- **Functions**: Add `useAsyncList` and `useCollator` functions for managing asynchronous list operations and
  locale-aware string comparison
- **Toast**: Export type definitions `ToastActionOptions`, `ToastPlacement`, `ToastPromiseOptions`, `ToastStatus`,
  `ToastStatusChangeDetails`, and `ToastType`

### Changed

- **Fieldset**
  - Update Legend component to render as `div` instead of `legend` element for improved styling flexibility
  - Add `aria-labelledby` attribute to fieldset root for better accessibility by linking to legend

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**
  - Clear hovered range state after completing range selection instead of waiting for pointer to leave the calendar
    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details
  - Track collection changes and clear `highlightedValue` if the item is no longer in the collection.

- **ScrollArea**
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.
  - Add `data-dragging` attribute to scroll area parts.

- **Select**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Combobox**: Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Carousel**:
  - Fix an issue where the carousel would not update when `slideCount` or `autoplay` props change.
  - Fix an issue where `loop: false` was ignored when using autoplay. Now, the carousel will stop when it gets to the
    last slide.

- **Date Picker**: Expose `data-inline` attribute on Content part to enable distinct styling for inline date pickers
  versus popover date pickers.

- **Menu**: Fix issue where `onCheckedChange` could be called twice on checkbox or radio item

## [5.3.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- **Collection**: Add `useListSelection` function for managing collection item selection with support for
  single/multiple selection modes

  ```js
  const collection = createListCollection({ items: ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular'] })
  const selection = useListSelection({ collection })

  // Check if item is selected
  const isSelected = selection.isSelected('Svelte')

  // Select/deselect items
  selection.select('Svelte')
  selection.toggle('Angular')
  ```

- **File Upload**: Add support for `bind:acceptedFiles` and `defaultAcceptedFiles` to programmatically control the
  accepted files

- **Signature Pad**: Add support for `bind:paths` and `defaultPaths` to programmatically control the paths

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**: Fix date comparison issues when time components are involved. This resolves critical issues with date
  comparison operations when different date types (`CalendarDate`, `CalendarDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`) are mixed,
  particularly in scenarios involving time components.

  - Fix issue where calling `api.setFiles` invokes validation with incorrect `acceptedFiles`
  - Fix issue where the browser might not be able to infer the mime type of a file due to limitations, drag source or
    security restrictions. As a fallback in the file validation logic, we now infer the mime type from the file
    extension.

  Now, you can pass `bind:ref` to all components.

  ```svelte
  <script lang="ts">
    let rootNode = $state<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)

    $inspect(rootNode)
  </script>

  <Accordion.Root bind:ref={rootNode}>
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
