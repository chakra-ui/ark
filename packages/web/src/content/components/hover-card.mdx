import Story from '~/components/story.astro'

## Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  HoverCard,
  HoverCardTrigger,
  HoverCardContent,
  HoverCardArrow,
  HoverCardArrowTip,
  HoverCardPositioner,
  Portal,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is an example of how to use the `HoverCard` component:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled HoverCard

The controlled `HoverCard` component provides an interface for managing the
state of the hover card using the `open` prop. The `onClose` prop is called when
the hover card needs to be closed:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Custom Positioning

The `HoverCard` component can be customized in its placement and distance from
the trigger element through the `positioning` prop:

<Story id="Positioning" />

## Render Prop Usage

The `HoverCard` component can also accept a render prop, giving the user more
control over rendering behavior. This is useful for dynamically updating the
trigger based on the state of the `HoverCard`:

<Story id="RenderProp" />

## Conclusion

The `HoverCard` component is an intuitive and powerful tool for displaying
contextual information in your applications. With its range of features and high
degree of customizability, it can meet a wide variety of design and
functionality requirements.
