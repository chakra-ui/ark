import Story from '~/components/story.astro'

## Basic Usage

To get started, import the necessary components from the package:

```jsx
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselControl,
  CarouselNextSlideTrigger,
  CarouselPrevSlideTrigger,
  CarouselSlide,
  CarouselSlideGroup,
  CarouselViewport,
  CarouselIndicator,
  CarouselIndicatorGroup,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here's an example of how to use the Carousel component with a set of images:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Controlled Carousel

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the
carousel using the `index` prop and update it when the `onSlideChange` event
handler is called:

```tsx
const ControlledCarousel = () => {
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0)

  const handleSlideChange = (details) => {
    setCurrentIndex(details.index)
  }

  return (
    <Carousel index={currentIndex} onSlideChange={handleSlideChange}>
      {/* ... */}
    </Carousel>
  )
}
```

## Customizing the Carousel

You can customize the Carousel component by setting various props such as
`align`, `loop`, `slidesPerView`, and `spacing`. Here's an example of a
customized Carousel:

```tsx
const CustomCarousel = () => {
  return (
    <Carousel
      align="center"
      loop={true}
      slidesPerView={2}
      spacing="16px"
      orientation="horizontal"
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Carousel>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

The Carousel component offers a flexible and powerful solution for displaying
dynamic content in your applications. With its comprehensive set of features and
customizability, it can accommodate a wide range of use cases and designs.
