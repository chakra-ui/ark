## Our Vision

Common UI patterns such as accordions, checkboxes, comboboxes, dialogs,
dropdowns, selects, sliders, and tooltips are widely understood in the
development community, but their web platform implementations often fall short.
As a result, developers are often left to build custom components, which can be
a difficult and time-consuming task.

The goal of Ark UI is to provide a well-funded, open-source component library
that can be used to build accessible design systems, solving these
implementation issues.

## Key Features

- **Accessible**: Components in Ark UI are designed with accessibility in mind,
  adhering to WAI-ARIA design patterns and handling implementation details such
  as aria and role attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation.
- **Unstyled**: Components are shipped without styles, giving developers full
  control over styling.
- **Customizable**: The open component architecture allows for customization and
  customization, providing granular access to each component part.
- **Uncontrolled or Controlled**: Components can be uncontrolled by default or
  controlled alternatively.
- **Developer Experience**: The library provides a fully-typed API with a
  consistent and predictable experience.

## Conclusion

Ark UI is a comprehensive UI component library designed to simplify the process
of building accessible, high-quality web applications.
