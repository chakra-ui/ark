description: Customize component rendering with the asChild prop
---

## Overview

Ark UI offers a flexible way to render components using the `asChild` prop. This
prop allows you to replace the default component with a custom child element
while maintaining the necessary behavior, such as event handling, and passing
down props and refs.

Every component that is exported in Ark UI has support for the `asChild` prop.

> **Note:** When using the `asChild` prop, be sure that the element you're
> rendering matches the tag name of the original component. Changing the
> underlying tags might affect the accessibility and functionality.

## Usage

Consider a component like `Menu.Trigger`, which also supports the `asChild`
prop.

### Default Behavior

By default, the original `Menu.Trigger` component will be rendered with its
default appearance and behavior:

```jsx
<Menu.Trigger>Open Menu</Menu.Trigger>
```

### Customizing with asChild

To replace the default `Menu.Trigger` with a custom child element (e.g., a
Button), set the `asChild` prop to true and pass the custom child element:

```jsx
<Menu.Trigger asChild>
  <Button>Open Menu</Button>
</Menu.Trigger>
```

When using the `asChild` prop, the library ensures that the custom child element
receives all the required props from the parent component and combines them with
the child's existing props. In addition, if a ref is provided, it will be
composed with the child's ref and passed down correctly.

## Limitations

When using the `asChild` prop, ensure that you only pass a single child element.
If you pass multiple children, the component may not render correctly.

Some components may have specific requirements for the child element, such as
the `Checkbox.Root`, `RadioGroup.Item` and `Switch.Root` component, which
requires a `label` element to be passed as a child element.

## Summary

The `asChild` prop provides a convenient way to customize the appearance and
behavior of components in Ark UI, such as `Menu.Trigger`. Use the `asChild` prop
to replace the original component with a custom child element, and the library
will take care of merging and forwarding props and refs as needed.
