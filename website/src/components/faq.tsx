        <div>
          Ark UI is a powerful headless component library that provides more than 40+ components and tools to help you
          build accessible, complex, and feature-rich UI design systems.

      question: "Isn't support for multiple frameworks bad for performance?",
      answer: (
        <div>
          No - in fact, the opposite is true. In our latest release, Ark UI{' '}
          <Link href="/docs/overview/changelog#500---2025-03-06">outperformed</Link> other headless component libraries
          that were built exclusively for a single framework.

      question: "Isn't supporting multiple frameworks time-consuming?",
      answer: (
        <div>
          Not really. At its core, most components are designed as finite state machines that interact solely with the
          DOM. Framework-specific adapters handle events and state management, ensuring that multi-framework support
          remains lightweight and highly efficient.

      question: 'Which JavaScript frameworks are supported?',
      answer: (
        <div>
          Ark UI currently supports React, Solid, and Vue. We began development for Svelte support earlier this year.
