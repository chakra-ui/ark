## Utilizing Utility Classes

Utility classes provide a flexible way to style your components. This method is
especially effective when integrating Ark UI with CSS frameworks like
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/), or
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). These frameworks offer an extensive range
of utility classes that can significantly speed up the development process and
enhance the design consistency of your project.

### Example with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is known for its utility-first approach, offering a wide array of
classes for various styling needs. Below is an example demonstrating how to use
Tailwind CSS classes with the Ark UI `Tabs` component:

```tsx
<Tabs.Root>
  <Tabs.List className="flex flex-wrap text-sm font-medium text-center text-gray-500 border-b border-gray-200">
    <Tabs.Trigger
      value="react"
      className="inline-block p-4 text-blue-600 bg-gray-100 rounded-t-lg border-b border-gray-200"
    >
      React
    </Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
</Tabs.Root>
```
