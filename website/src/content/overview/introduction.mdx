import { Faq } from '~/components/docs/faq'


## Motivation

Most popular component libraries are designed to work with a specific JavaScript framework. 
While this setup works fine for individuals and small businesses,
it can pose challenges for larger organizations or agencies dealing with various clients or teams that use different technology stacks.

## Solution

The goal of Ark UI is to provide a comprehensive selection of components for implementing complex, 
interactive, and accessible UI components across a wide range of JavaScript frameworks.
Building a company-wide design system or a component library for a client has never been more straightforward.
