## Setup Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisite" number="1">

Before you start, ensure that you have a proper project setup. If not, please follow your preffered application framework setup guide and once you've completed that, come back to this guide.


</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

Let's start by installing the Ark UI package. Make sure to pick the either the React, Solid or Vue package based on your project setup.

```bash multi
npm install @ark-ui/react
```

</Step>
<Step number="3" title="Add a component">

In this guide, we will be adding a Slider component. Copy the following code to your project.

<Story id="Basic" component="slider" />

</Step>
<Step number="4" title="Style a component">

Ark UI is a headless component library that doesn't include default styles.
Nowadays, projects often use CSS-in-JS libraries like [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) or frameworks like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style their components.

However, if you prefer to write your own CSS, you can leverage the `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to style your components.

```css
/* Targets the slider root part */
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='root'] {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```
