## Examples

The `Fieldset` component provides contexts such as `invalid` and `disabled` for form elements.
While most Ark UI components natively support these contexts, you can also use the `Field` component with standard HTML form elements.

### Basic Usage

Learn how to use the `Fieldset` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Fieldset with Fields

This example demonstrates how to use the `Field` component with a standard input field within a `Fieldset`.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Fieldset with other Form Elements

This example shows how to use the `Fieldset` component with other Ark UI form elements like `Checkbox`.

<Example id="with-checkbox" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the fieldset. It accepts the value of the `useFieldset` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the fieldset.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
