<ComponentPreview id="Timer" />

## Anatomy

To set up the timer correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="timer" />

```tsx
<Timer.Root>
  <Timer.Area>
    <Timer.Item />
    <Timer.Separator />
  </Timer.Area>
  <Timer.Control>
    <Timer.ActionTrigger />
  </Timer.Control>
</Timer.Root>
```

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Timer` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Countdown

You can create a countdown timer by setting the `countdown` prop to `true` and `startMs` to the initial time:

<Example id="countdown" />

### Interval

Use the `interval` prop to control how frequently the timer updates. This is useful for displaying milliseconds:

<Example id="interval" />

### Events

The Timer component provides events that you can listen to for various timer-related actions.

- The `onComplete` event is triggered when the timer reaches its target time.
- The `onTick` event is called on each timer update, providing details about the current timer state.

<Example id="events" />

### Pomodoro

Here's an example of building a pomodoro timer that alternates between work and break sessions:

<Example id="pomodoro" />

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the timer. It accepts the value of the `useTimer` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the timer.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
