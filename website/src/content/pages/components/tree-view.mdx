## Anatomy

To set up the tree view component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="tree-view" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `TreeView` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Expanded

Pass the `expandedValue` and `onExpandedChange` props to the `TreeView.Root` component to control the expanded state of
the tree view.

<Example id="controlled-expanded" />

### Controlled Selection

Pass the `selectedValue` and `onSelectionChange` props to the `TreeView.Root` component to control the selected state of
the tree view.

<Example id="controlled-selected" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useTreeView` hook to create the tree view store and pass it to the `TreeView.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the tree view programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a feature that allows the tree view to load children of a node on demand (or async). This helps to
improve the initial load time and memory usage.

To use this, you need to provide the following:

- `loadChildren` — A function that is used to load the children of a node.
- `onLoadChildrenComplete` — A callback that is called when the children of a node are loaded. Used to update the tree
  collection.
- `childrenCount` — A number that indicates the number of children of a branch node.

<Example id="async-loading" />
