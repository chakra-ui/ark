## Steps

### Using step types

The tour machine supports different types of steps, allowing you to create a
diverse and interactive tour experience. The available step types are defined in
the `StepType` type:

- `tooltip`: Displays the step content as a tooltip, typically positioned near
  the target element.

- `dialog`: Shows the step content in a modal dialog centered on screen,
  useful for starting or ending the tour. This usually don't have a `target`
  defined.

- `floating`: Presents the step content as a floating element, which can be
  positioned flexibly on the screen. This usually don't have a `target` defined.

- `wait`: A special type that waits for a specific condition before proceeding
  to the next step.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    placement: 'top-start',
    target: () => document.querySelector('#target-1'),
    title: 'Tooltip Step',
    description: 'This is a tooltip step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-2',
    type: 'dialog',
    title: 'Dialog Step',
    description: 'This is a dialog step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-3',
    type: 'floating',
    placement: 'top-start',
    title: 'Floating Step',
    description: 'This is a floating step',
  },
  {
    id: 'step-4',
    type: 'wait',
    title: 'Wait Step',
    description: 'This is a wait step',
    effect({ next }) {
      // do something and go next
      // you can also return a cleanup
    },
  },
]
```

### Configuring actions

Every step supports a list of actions that are rendered in the step footer.Use
the `actions` property to define each action.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'dialog',
    title: 'Dialog Step',
    description: 'This is a dialog step',
    actions: [{ label: 'Show me a tour!', action: 'next' }],
  },
]
```

### Changing tooltip placement

Use the `placement` property to define the placement of the tooltip.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    placement: 'top-start',
    // ...
  },
]
```

### Hiding the arrow

Set `arrow: false` in the step property to hide the tooltip arrow. This is only
useful for tooltip steps.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    arrow: false,
  },
]
```

### Hiding the backdrop

Set `backdrop: false` in the step property to hide the backdrop. This applies to
all step types except the `wait` step.

```tsx {5}
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'dialog',
    backdrop: false,
  },
]
```

### Step Effects

Step effects are functions that are called before a step is opened. They are
useful for adding custom logic to a step.

This function provides the following methods:

- `next()`: Call this method to move to the next step.
- `show()`: Call this method to show the current step.
- `update(details: StepDetails)`: Call this method to update the details of the
  current step (say, after data has been fetched).

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'tooltip',
    effect({ next, show, update }) {
      fetchData().then((res) => {
        // update the step details
        update({ title: res.title })
        // then show show the step
        show()
      })

      return () => {
        // cleanup fetch data
      }
    },
  },
]
```

### Wait Steps

Wait steps are useful when you need to wait for a specific condition before
proceeding to the next step.

Use the step `effect` function to perform an action and then call `next()` to
move to the next step.

> **Note:** You cannot call `show()` in a wait step.

```tsx
const steps: TourStepDetails[] = [
  {
    id: 'step-1',
    type: 'wait',
    effect({ next }) {
      const button = document.querySelector('#button')
      const listener = () => next()
      button.addEventListener('click', listener)
      return () => button.removeEventListener('click', listener)
    },
  },
]
```
