<ComponentPreview id="HoverCard" />

## Anatomy

To set up the hover card correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `HoverCard` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled HoverCard

The controlled `HoverCard` component provides an interface for managing the state of the hover card
using the `open` and `onOpenChange` props:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Custom Positioning

The `HoverCard` component can be customized in its placement and distance from the trigger element
through the `positioning` prop:

<Example id="positioning" />

### Render Prop Usage

The `HoverCard` component can also accept a render prop, giving the user more control over rendering
behavior. This is useful for dynamically updating the trigger based on the state of the `HoverCard`:

<Example id="render-prop" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the hover-card. It accepts the value of the `useHover-card` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the hover-card.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
