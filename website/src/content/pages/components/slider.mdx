## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="slider" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Slider` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Range Slider

You can add multiple thumbs to the slider by adding multiple `Slider.Thumb`

<Example id="range" />

### Adding marks

You can add marks to the slider track by using the `Slider.MarkerGroup` and `Slider.Marker`
components.

Position the `Slider.Marker` components relative to the track by providing the `value` prop.

<Example id="with-marks" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the slider's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the array of numbers.

<Example id="initial-value" />

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily
specify different bounds by changing the values of the `min` and/or `max` props.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

<Example id="min-max" />

### Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an integer. You can change the
step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal places, you should
set the value of step to `0.01`:

<Example id="step" />

### Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onValueChange` and `onValueChangeEnd` callbacks are invoked. You
can use this to set up custom behaviors in your app.

<Example id="on-event" />

### Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to vertical, set the
orientation property in the machine's context to vertical.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its height

<Example id="vertical" />

### Changing the origin

By default, the slider's origin is at the start of the track. To change the origin to the center of
the track, set the `origin` prop to `center`.

<Example id="center-origin" />
