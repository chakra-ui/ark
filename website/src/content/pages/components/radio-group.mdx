<ComponentPreview id="RadioGroup" />

## Anatomy

To set up the radio group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its
parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="radio-group" />

### Design impact on the asChild property

The `RadioGroup.Item` element of the radio group is a `label` element. This is because the radio
group is a form control and should be associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the
user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility structure will be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child
> of the `RadioGroup.Item` component.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `RadioGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Disabling the radio group

To make a radio group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

<Example id="disabled" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the radio group's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to the value of the radio item
to be selected by default.

<Example id="initial-value" />

### Listening for changes

When the radio group value changes, the `onValueChange` callback is invoked.

<Example id="on-event" />
