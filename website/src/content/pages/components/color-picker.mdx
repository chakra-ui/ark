## Anatomy

To set up the color picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its
parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `ColorPicker` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Color Picker

To create a controlled Color Picker component, manage the state of the current color using the
`value` prop and update it when the `onValueChange` or `onValueChangeEnd` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a color picker.
It includes handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the color-picker. It accepts the value of the `useColor-picker` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the color-picker.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
