## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Combobox` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example

<Example id="basic" />

### Advanced Customization

Extended example that shows usage with complex item objects, including disabled
state for certain options.

## TypeScript Caveats in Vue

Under the hood for React and Solid frameworks, we supply a complex prop type
with a generic so that the type of the `items` prop matches the param type in
the function signatures for props such as the `isItemDisabled` prop, say. (See
the api reference table below) Unfortunately, generic typing is not supported in
Vue for components that contain props with slots and/or emits. Therefore, you
will not expect updated typing in this way.

If you have a solution or a workaround to this problem, we would love the
contribution and request that you
[open a Github idea discussion](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/discussions/new?category=ideas)
to let us know a PoC you have to share!
