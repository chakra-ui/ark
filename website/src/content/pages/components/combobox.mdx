## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="combobox" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Combobox` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

<Example id="basic" />

### Grouping

To group related combobox items, use the `groupBy` prop on the collection and `collection.group()` to iterate the
groups.

<Example id="grouping" />

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a combobox. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useCombobox` hook to create the combobox store and pass it to the `Combobox.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the combobox programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `Combobox.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Combobox.Root` component.

### Links

Use the `asChild` prop to render the combobox items as links.

<Example id="links" />

For custom router links, you can customize the `navigate` prop on the `Combobox.Root` component.

Here's an example of using the Tanstack Router.

```tsx
import { Combobox } from '@ark-ui/react/combobox'
import { useNavigate } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function Demo() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  return (
    <Combobox.Root
      navigate={(e) => {
        navigate({ to: e.node.href })
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Combobox.Root>
  )
}
```
