title: Signature Pad
description: A component that allows users to draw a signature using a signature pad.

<ComponentPreview id="SignaturePad" />

## Anatomy

To set up the signature pad correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="signature-pad" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Signature Pad` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Image Preview

After the user draws a signature, you can display a preview of the signature as an image. This is useful when you want
to show the user a preview of the signature before saving it.

<Example id="image-preview" />

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a signature pad. It includes
handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useSignaturePad` hook to create the signature pad store and pass it to the `SignaturePad.RootProvider`
component. This allows you to have maximum control over the signature pad programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
