## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Setup

To use the Toast component, create the toast engine using the `createToaster` function.

This function manages the placement and grouping of toasts, and provides a `toast` object needed
to create toast notification.

```ts
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: 'bottom-end',
  overlap: true,
  gap: 24,
})
```

## Examples

Here's an example of creating a toast using the `toast.create` method.

### Update Toast

To update a toast, use the `toast.update` method.

<Example id="update" />

### Action

To add an action to a toast, use the `toast.action` property.

<Example id="action" />
