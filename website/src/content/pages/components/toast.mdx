## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

To use the Toast component in your application, you need to set it up using the `createToaster`
hook. This hook manages the placement and grouping of toasts, and provides a `toast` object needed
to create toast notification.

To create a basic Toast, use the `toast.create` method to display a notification.
