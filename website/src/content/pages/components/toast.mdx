## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

To use the Toast component in your application, you need to set it up using the
`createToaster` hook. This hook manages the placement and grouping of toasts,
and provides a `toast` object needed to create toast notification.

To create a basic Toast, use the `toast.create` method to display a
notification.

<Example id="basic" />

### Configuring Toast

To configure the Toast component, you can pass various options to the
`toast.create` method. These options include `title`, `description`, `type`,
`duration`, and `removeDelay`:

<Example id="customized" />

### Custom Rendered Toast

For cases where you need more flexibility in rendering, the Toast component
offers the ability to use a custom render function. This allows you to customize
the content of the toast:
