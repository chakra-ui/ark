## Anatomy

To set up the rating correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `RatingGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Using half ratings

Allow `0.5` value steps by setting the `allowHalf` prop to `true`. Ensure to
render the correct icon if the `isHalf` value is set in the Rating components
render callback.

<Example id="half-ratings" />

### Using a default value

<Example id="initial-value" />

### Controlled

When using the `RatingGroup` component, you can use the `value` and
`onValueChange` props to control the state.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Disabling the rating group

To make the rating group disabled, set the `disabled` prop to `true`.

<Example id="disabled" />

### Readonly rating group

To make the rating group readonly, set the `readOnly` prop to `true`.

<Example id="read-only" />

### Usage within forms

To use the rating group within forms, pass the prop `name`. It will render a
hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form correctly.
