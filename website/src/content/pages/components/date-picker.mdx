## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="date-picker" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `DatePicker` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` prop to control the date picker's value.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Range Selection

To create a date picker that allows a range selection, you need to:

- Set the `selectionMode` prop to `range`.
- Render multiple inputs with the `index` prop set to `0` and `1`.

<Example id="range" />

### Multiple Months

To create a date picker that allows multiple months, you need to:

- Set the `numOfMonths` prop to the number of months you want to display.
- Use the `datePicker.getOffset({ months: 1 })` prop to offset the date picker to the next month.
- Render a `DatePicker.RangeText` component to display the range text.

<Example id="multiple-months" />

### Standalone

In some cases, you might want to display a non-dismissible date picker. This can be achieved by setting the `open` prop
to `true` and `closeOnSelect` prop to `false`.

> Important to note that standalone date picker doesn't use the `Portal`, `Positioner` and `Content` components.

<Example id="standalone" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useDatePicker` hook to create the date picker store and pass it to the `DatePicker.RootProvider` component.
This allows you to have maximum control over the date picker programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `DatePicker.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `DatePicker.Root` component.
