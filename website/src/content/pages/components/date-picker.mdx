<ComponentPreview id="DatePicker" />

## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its
parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `DatePicker` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example

<Example id="basic" />

### Range Selection

To create a Date Picker that allows a range selection, set the `selectionMode` prop to `range`.

<Example id="range" />

### Standalone Date Picker

In some cases, you might want to display a non-dismissible date picker. This can be achieved by
setting the `open` prop to `true` and `closeOnSelect` prop to `false`.

> Important to note that standalone date picker doesn't use the `Portal`, `Positioner` and `Content`
> components.

<Example id="standalone" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the date-picker. It accepts the value of the `useDate-picker` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the date-picker.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
