id: presence
title: Presence
description: Helps control the rendering and unmounting of your content based on a given state.

## Examples

By default the child component starts out as hidden and remains hidden after the `present` state is
toggled off. This is useful for situations where the element needs to be hidden initially and
continue to stay hidden after its presence is no longer required.

<Example id="basic" />

### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of a child component until the `present` prop is set to true, use the
`lazyMount` prop:

<Example id="lazy-mount" />

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the child component from the DOM when it's not present, use the `unmountOnExit` prop:

<Example id="unmount-on-exit" />

### Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined for a component to be mounted only when it's
present and to be unmounted when it's no longer present:

<Example id="lazy-mount-and-unmount-on-exit" />
