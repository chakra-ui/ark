## Anatomy

To set up the editable correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `FloatingPanel` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlling the size

To control the size of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `size` `onResize` prop to the machine.

<Example id="controlled-size" />

### Controlling the position

To control the position of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `position` and `onPositionChange` prop
to the machine.

<Example id="controlled-position" />

### Anchor position

Use the `getAnchorPosition` function to compute the initial position of the floating panel. This function is called when
the panel is opened and receives the `triggerRect` and `boundaryRect`.

<Example id="anchor-position" />

### Controlling the open state

To control the open state of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the `open` and `onOpenChange` prop to the
machine.

<Example id="controlled-open" />

### Lazy mounting

To lazy mount the floating panel, you can pass the `lazyMount` prop to the machine.

<Example id="lazy-mount" />

### Context

To access the context of the floating panel, you can use the `useFloatingPanelContext` hook or the
`FloatingPanel.Context` component.

<Example id="render-fn" />
