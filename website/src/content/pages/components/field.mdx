## Examples

While most Ark UI components natively support these contexts, you can also use the `Field` component with standard HTML form elements.

### Input

This example shows how to use the `Field` component with a standard input field.

<Example id="input" />

### Textarea

This example illustrates how to use the `Field` component with a textarea element.

<Example id="textarea" />

### Select

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `Field` component with a select dropdown.

<Example id="select" />

### Using Ark Components

This example demonstrates how to integrate the `Field` and `Checkbox` components.
For more examples of using the `Field` component with various Ark UI elements, refer to their respective documentation.

<Example component="checkbox" id="with-field" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the field. It accepts the value of the `useField` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the field.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
