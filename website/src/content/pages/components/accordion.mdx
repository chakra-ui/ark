## Anatomy

To set up the accordion correctly, it's essential to understand its anatomy and the naming of its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="accordion" />

## Examples

### Default Expanded State

Set the `defaultValue` prop to specify which item should be expanded by default.

<Example id="basic" />

### Collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow the user to collapse all panels.

<Example id="collapsible" />

### Multiple Panels

Use the `multiple` prop to allow multiple panels to be expanded simultaneously.

<Example id="multiple" />

### Horizontal Orientation

By default, the Accordion is oriented vertically. Use the `orientation` prop to switch to a horizontal layout.

<Example id="horizontal" />

### Animate Content Size

Use the `--height` and/or `--width` CSS variables to animate the size of the content when it expands or closes:

```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    opacity: 0.01;
    height: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    height: var(--height);
  }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
    height: var(--height);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0.01;
    height: 0;
  }
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: slideDown 250ms ease-in-out;
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: slideUp 200ms ease-in-out;
}
```

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the accordion. It accepts the value of the `useAccordion` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the accordion.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Accessing the focused item

Use the `focusedValue` property to get the value of the focused accordion item.

<Example id="context/focusedValue" />

### Accessing the selected items

Use the `value` property to get the selected accordion items.

<Example id="context/value" />

### Setting the selected items

Use the `setValue` method to set the selected accordion items.

<Example id="context/setValue" />

### Accessing an item's state

Use the `getItemState` method to get the state of an accordion item.

<Example id="context/getItemState" />
