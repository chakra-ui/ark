## Anatomy

To set up the select correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="select" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Select` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected items.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Grouping

Grouping related options can be useful for organizing options into categories.

- Use the `groupBy` prop to configure the grouping of the items.
- Use the `collection.group()` method to get the grouped items.
- Use the `Select.ItemGroup` and `Select.ItemGroupLabel` components to render the grouped items.

<Example id="grouping" />

### Multiple

To enable `multiple` item selection:

<Example id="multiple" />

### Form Usage

Here's an example of integrating the `Select` component with a form library.

<Example id="form-library" />

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a select. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Async Loading

Here's an example of how to load the items asynchronously when the select is opened.

<Example id="async" />

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the select. It accepts the value of the `useSelect` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the select.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Select on Highlight

Here's an example of automatically selecting items when they are highlighted (hovered or navigated to with keyboard).

<Example id="select-on-highlight" />

### Max Selection

Here's an example of limiting the number of items that can be selected in a multiple select.

<Example id="max-selected" />

### Lazy Mount

The `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` props allow you to control when the select content is mounted and unmounted from the
DOM. This can improve performance by only rendering the content when needed.

<Example id="lazy-mount" />

### Select All

Use the `selectAll()` method from the select context to select all items at once. This is useful for multi-select
scenarios where users need to quickly select everything.

<Example id="select-all" />

### Overflow

For selects with many items, use `positioning.fitViewport` to ensure the dropdown fits within the viewport. Combine with
a max-height on the content to enable scrolling.

<Example id="overflow" />

## Guides

### Type Safety

The `Select.RootComponent` type enables you to create typed wrapper components that maintain full type safety for
collection items.

```tsx
import { Select as ArkSelect } from '@ark-ui/react/select'

const Select: ArkSelect.RootComponent = (props) => {
  return <ArkSelect.Root {...props}>{/* ... */}</ArkSelect.Root>
}
```

Use the wrapper with full type inference on `onValueChange` and other callbacks:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const collection = createListCollection({
    initialItems: [
      { label: 'React', value: 'react' },
      { label: 'Vue', value: 'vue' },
    ],
  })
  return (
    <Select
      collection={collection}
      onValueChange={(e) => {
        // e.items is typed as Array<{ label: string, value: string }>
        console.log(e.items)
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Select>
  )
}
```

### Nested Usage

When using the Select component within a `Popover` or `Dialog`, avoid rendering its content within a `Portal` or
`Teleport`.

This ensures the Select's content stays within the Popover/Dialog's DOM hierarchy rather than being portalled to the
document body, maintaining proper interaction and accessibility behavior.

### Hidden Select

The `Select.HiddenSelect` component renders a native HTML `<select>` element that's visually hidden but remains in the
DOM. This component is essential for:

- **Form submission**: Native form submission and serialization work seamlessly since the actual `<select>` element
  exists in the DOM
- **Browser auto-fill**: Browsers can properly auto-fill the select based on previously submitted form data
- **Progressive enhancement**: Forms remain functional even if JavaScript fails to load

```tsx
<Select.Root>
  <Select.HiddenSelect />
  {/* Other Select components */}
</Select.Root>
```

The hidden select automatically syncs with the Select component's value, ensuring form data is always up-to-date.

### Empty State

You can create an empty state component that displays when there are no items in the collection. Use the
`useSelectContext` hook to check the collection size:

```tsx
const SelectEmpty = (props: React.ComponentProps<'div'>) => {
  const select = useSelectContext()
  if (select.collection.size === 0) {
    return <div {...props} role="presentation" />
  }
  return null
}
```

Then use it within your Select content:

```tsx
<Select.Content>
  <SelectEmpty>No items to display</SelectEmpty>
  {/* Your items */}
</Select.Content>
```

### Available Size

The following css variables are exposed to the `Select.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Select.Content`

```css
/* width of the select trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, you can use the following:

```css
[data-scope='select'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```
