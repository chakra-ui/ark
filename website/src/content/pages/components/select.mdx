## Anatomy

To set up the select correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="select" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Select` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Value

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected items.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Grouping

Grouping related options can be useful for organizing options into categories.

- Use the `groupBy` prop to configure the grouping of the items.
- Use the `collection.group()` method to get the grouped items.
- Use the `Select.ItemGroup` and `Select.ItemGroupLabel` components to render the grouped items.

<Example id="grouping" />

### Multiple Selection

To enable `multiple` item selection:

<Example id="multiple" />

### Form Library

Here's an example of integrating the `Select` component with a form library.

<Example id="form-library" />

### Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a select. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Async Loading

Here's an example of how to load the items asynchronously when the select is opened.

<Example id="async" />

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the select. It accepts the value of the `useSelect` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the select.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Select on Highlight

Here's an example of automatically selecting items when they are highlighted (hovered or navigated to with keyboard).

<Example id="select-on-highlight" />

### Maximum Selected Items

Here's an example of limiting the number of items that can be selected in a multiple select.

<Example id="max-selected" />

## Guides

### Usage in Popover or Dialog

When using the Select component within a `Popover` or `Dialog`, avoid rendering its content within a `Portal` or
`Teleport`.

This ensures the Select's content stays within the Popover/Dialog's DOM hierarchy rather than being portalled to the
document body, maintaining proper interaction and accessibility behavior.

### Available height and width

The following css variables are exposed to the `Select.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Select.Content`

```css
/* width of the select trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, you can use the following:

```css
[data-scope='select'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```
