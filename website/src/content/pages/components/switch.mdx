<ComponentPreview id="Switch" />

## Anatomy

<Anatomy id="switch" />

```tsx
<Switch.Root>
  <Switch.Control>
    <Switch.Thumb />
  </Switch.Control>
  <Switch.Label />
  <Switch.HiddenInput />
</Switch.Root>
```

## Examples

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the checked prop, and updates when the
`onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Context

The Switch component allows access to its internal state through the `Context` component. This enables you to
dynamically adjust and customize aspects of the component based on its current state:

<Example id="context" />

### Field

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a switch. It includes handling
ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the switch is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSwitch` hook. This way you
can access the state and methods from outside the component.

<Example id="root-provider" />

## Guides

### asChild

The `Switch.Root` element of the switch is a `label` element. This is because the switch is a form control and should be
associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility structure will
be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child of the `Switch.Root`
> component.
