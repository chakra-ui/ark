## Anatomy

To set up the avatar correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="avatar" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Avatar` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Handling Events

`Avatar` allows you to listen for loading state changes.

<Example id="events" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the avatar. It accepts the value of the `useAvatar` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the avatar.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
