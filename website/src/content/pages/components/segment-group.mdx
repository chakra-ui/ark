## Anatomy

To set up the segmented control correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its
parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="segmented-control" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `SegmentGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Initial Value

To set a default segment on initial render, use the `defaultValue` prop:

<Example id="initial-value" />

### Controlled Segment Group

To create a controlled SegmentGroup component, manage the current selected segment using the `value`
prop and update it when the `onValueChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Disabled Segment

To disable a segment, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `SegmentGroup.Item` component:

<Example id="disabled" />
