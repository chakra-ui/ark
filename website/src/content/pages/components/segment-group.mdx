## Anatomy

To set up the segmented control correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy
and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="segmented-control" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `SegmentGroup` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Initial Value

To set a default segment on initial render, use the `defaultValue` prop:

<Example id="initialValue" />

### Controlled Segment Group

To create a controlled SegmentGroup component, manage the current selected
segment using the `value` prop and update it when the `onValueChange` event
handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Disabled Segment

To disable a segment, simply pass the `disabled` prop to the `SegmentGroup.Item`
component:

<Example id="disabled" />
