## Anatomy

To set up the Listbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

{/* <Anatomy id="listbox" /> */}

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a basic example of the Listbox component.

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

The Listbox component can be controlled by using the `value` and `onValueChange` props. This allows you to manage the
selected value externally.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Disabled Item

Listbox items can be disabled using the `disabled` prop on the collection item.

<Example id="disabled" />

> You can also use the `isItemDisabled` within the `createListCollection` to disable items based on a condition.

### Multiple Selection

You can set the `selectionMode` property as `multiple` to allow the user to select multiple items at a time.

<Example id="multiple" />

### Grouping

The Listbox component supports grouping items. You can use the `groupBy` function to group items based on a specific
property.

<Example id="group" />
