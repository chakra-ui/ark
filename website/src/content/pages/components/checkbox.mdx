## Anatomy

To set up the checkbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="checkbox" />

### Design impact on the asChild property

The `Checkbox.Root` element of the checkbox is a `label` element. This is because the checkbox is a
form control and should be associated with a label to provide context and meaning to the user.
Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility structure will be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element is the direct child
> of the `Checkbox.Root` component.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Checkbox` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Checkbox

To create a controlled Checkbox component, manage the state of the checked status using the
`checked` prop and update it when the `onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Indeterminate Checkbox

In some cases, you may need a checkbox to represent a state that is neither checked nor unchecked,
known as the indeterminate state. This can be achieved by setting the `checked` prop to
`indeterminate`:

<Example id="indeterminate" />

### Checkbox Group

Ark provides a `Checkbox.Group` component to manage a group of checkboxes. The `Checkbox.Group`
component manages the state of the checkboxes and provides a way to access the checked values:

<Example id="group" />

### Render Prop Usage

For cases where you need more flexibility in rendering, the Checkbox component offers the use of a
render prop. The render prop function gives you access to the checkbox's API, allowing you to
customize the checkbox control's rendering:

<Example id="render-prop" />

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of a checkbox.
It includes handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the checkbox. It accepts the value of the `useCheckbox` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the checkbox.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
