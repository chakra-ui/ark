## Anatomy

To set up the popover correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="popover" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Popover` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Using a Portal

By default, the popover is rendered in the same DOM hierarchy as the trigger. To
render the popover within a portal, set the `portalled` prop to `true`.

> Note: This requires that you render the component within a `Portal` based on
> the framework you use.

<Example id="portalled" />

### Adding an arrow

To render an arrow within the popover, render the component `Popover.Arrow` and
`Popover.ArrowTip` as children of `Popover.Positioner`.

<Example id="arrow" />

### Listening for open and close events

When the popover is opened or closed, we invoke the `onOpenChange` callback.

<Example id="onOpenChange" />

### Control the open state

Use the `isOpen` prop to control the open state of the popover.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Modifying the close behavior

The popover is designed to close on blur and when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is
pressed.

To prevent it from closing on blur (clicking or focusing outside), pass the
`closeOnInteractOutside` prop and set it to `false`.

To prevent it from closing when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed, pass the
`closeOnEsc` prop and set it to `false`.

<Example id="closeBehavior" />

### Changing the placement

To change the placement of the popover, set the `positioning` prop.

<Example id="positioning" />

### Changing the modality

In some cases, you might want the popover to be modal. This means that it'll:

- trap focus within its content
- block scrolling on the body
- disable pointer interactions outside the popover
- hide content behind the popover from screen readers

To make the popover modal, set the `modal` prop to `true`. When `modal={true}`,
we set the `portalled` attribute to `true` as well.

<Example id="modal" />
