## Anatomy

To set up the popover correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="popover" />

```tsx
<Popover.Root>
  <Popover.Trigger />
  <Popover.Anchor />
  <Popover.Positioner>
    <Popover.Arrow>
      <Popover.ArrowTip />
    </Popover.Arrow>
    <Popover.Content>
      <Popover.Title />
      <Popover.Description />
      <Popover.CloseTrigger />
    </Popover.Content>
  </Popover.Positioner>
</Popover.Root>
```

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Popover` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Arrow

To render an arrow within the popover, render the component `Popover.Arrow` and `Popover.ArrowTip` as children of
`Popover.Positioner`.

<Example id="arrow" />

### Controlled open state

Use the `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control the open state of the popover.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Close Behavior

The popover is designed to close on blur and when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed.

- To prevent it from closing on blur (clicking or focusing outside), pass the `closeOnInteractOutside` prop and set it
  to `false`.
- To prevent it from closing when the <kbd>esc</kbd> key is pressed, pass the `closeOnEsc` prop and set it to `false`.

<Example id="close-behavior" />

### Placement

To change the placement of the popover, set the `positioning` prop.

<Example id="positioning" />

### Modality

In some cases, you might want the popover to be modal. This means that it'll:

- trap focus within its content
- block scrolling on the body
- disable pointer interactions outside the popover
- hide content behind the popover from screen readers

To make the popover modal, set the `modal` prop to `true`. When `modal={true}`, we set the `portalled` attribute to
`true` as well.

<Example id="modal" />

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the popover. It accepts the value of the `usePopover` hook. You can
leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the popover.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.

### Dialog Integration

When rendering a popover inside a dialog, you have two options for proper layering:

1. **Keep the Portal with `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit`** - This ensures the popover is properly unmounted when the
   dialog closes, preventing stale DOM nodes.

2. **Remove the Portal** - Render the popover inline within the dialog content. This works well but may have z-index
   considerations.

<Example id="with-dialog" />

### Anchor

Use the `Popover.Anchor` component to position the popover relative to a different element than the trigger. This is
useful for form field hints or contextual help.

<Example id="anchor" />

### Nested

Popovers can be nested within each other. Each nested popover maintains its own open state and positioning.

<Example id="nested" />

### Same Width

Use `positioning.sameWidth` to make the popover match the width of its trigger element.

<Example id="same-width" />

## Guides

### Available Size

The following css variables are exposed to the `Popover.Positioner` which you can use to style the `Popover.Content`

```css
/* width of the popover trigger */
--reference-width: <pixel-value>;
/* width of the available viewport */
--available-width: <pixel-value>;
/* height of the available viewport */
--available-height: <pixel-value>;
```

For example, if you want to make sure the maximum height doesn't exceed the available height, use the following css:

```css
[data-scope='popover'][data-part='content'] {
  max-height: calc(var(--available-height) - 100px);
}
```
