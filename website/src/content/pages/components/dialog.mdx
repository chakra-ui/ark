## Anatomy

To use the dialog component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its
parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="dialog" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Dialog` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Dialog

To create a controlled Dialog component, manage the state of the dialog using the `open` and
`onOpenChange` props:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Lazy Mounting

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a dialog to be rendered only when the dialog
is first opened. This is useful for performance optimization, especially when dialog content is
large or complex. To enable lazy mounting, use the `lazyMount` prop on the `Dialog.Root` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with `lazyMount` to unmount the
dialog content when the Dialog is closed, freeing up resources. The next time the dialog is
activated, its content will be re-rendered.

<Example id="lazy-mount" />

### Using Render Function

The Dialog component supports the use of a render function as a child for more control. This allows
access to dialog states like `isOpen`:

<Example id="render-fn" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the dialog. It accepts the value of the `useDialog` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the dialog.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
