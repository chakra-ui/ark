## Anatomy

To set up the file upload component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="file-upload" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `FileUpload` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Validation

Use the `validate` prop to validate the files before they are uploaded. The return value of the function should map to:

- `TOO_MANY_FILES`: If the user tries to upload more files than the `maxFiles` prop allows.
- `FILE_INVALID_TYPE`: If the file is of an invalid type.
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE`: If the file is too large.
- `FILE_TOO_SMALL`: If the file is too small.
- `FILE_INVALID`: If the file is invalid (for any other reason).
- `FILE_EXISTS`: If the file already exists.

<Example id="validation" />

### Field

Here's an example of how to use the `FileUpload` component with the `Field` component to provide a error and helper
text.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useFileUpload` hook to create the file upload store and pass it to the `FileUpload.RootProvider` component.
This allows you to have maximum control over the file upload programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
