## Anatomy

To set up the file upload component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name
its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="file-upload" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `FileUpload` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Using the Field Component

The `Field` component helps manage form-related state and accessibility attributes of an file upload.
It includes handling ARIA labels, helper text, and error text to ensure proper accessibility.

<Example id="with-field" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the file-upload. It accepts the value of the `useFile-upload` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the file-upload.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
