## Anatomy

To set up the splitter correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Splitter` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Using Render Props

The Splitter component allows you to pass a function as a child to gain direct
access to its API. This provides more control and allows you to modify the size
of the panels programmatically:

<Example id="renderProp" />

### Handling Events

Splitter also provides `onSizeChangeStart` and `onSizeChangeEnd` events which
can be useful to perform some actions during the start and end of the resizing
process:

<Example id="events" />

### Vertical Splitter

By default, the Splitter component is horizontal. If you need a vertical
splitter, use the `orientation` prop:

<Example id="vertical" />
