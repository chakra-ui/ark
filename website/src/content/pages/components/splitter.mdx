## Anatomy

To set up the splitter correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="splitter" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Splitter` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Using Render Props

The Splitter component allows you to pass a function as a child to gain direct access to its API.
This provides more control and allows you to modify the size of the panels programmatically:

<Example id="render-prop" />

### Handling Events

Splitter also provides `onSizeChangeStart` and `onSizeChangeEnd` events which can be useful to
perform some actions during the start and end of the resizing process:

<Example id="events" />

### Vertical Splitter

By default, the Splitter component is horizontal. If you need a vertical splitter, use the
`orientation` prop:

<Example id="vertical" />
