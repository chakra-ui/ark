title: Progress - Circular
description: An element that shows either determinate or indeterminate progress.

<ComponentPreview id="ProgressCircular" />

## Anatomy

To set up the progress correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="circular-progress" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Progress` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the progress's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to a number.

<Example id="initial-value" />

### Specifying the maximum

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify a different
bound by changing the value of the `max` prop. You can do the same with the minimum value by setting
the `min` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress from `10` to `30`, you can use:

<Example id="min-max" />

### Using the indeterminate state

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to 50 and 100
respectively.

Set the `state` to `indeterminate` in `Progress.Indicator`:

<Example id="indeterminate" />

### Showing a value text

Progress bars can only be interpreted by sighted users. To include a text description to support
assistive technologies like screen readers, use the `value` part in `translations`.

<Example id="value-text" />
