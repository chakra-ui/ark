<ComponentPreview id="ProgressCircular" />

## Anatomy

<Anatomy id="circular-progress" />

```tsx
<Progress.Root>
  <Progress.Label />
  <Progress.ValueText />
  <Progress.Circle>
    <Progress.CircleTrack />
    <Progress.CircleRange />
  </Progress.Circle>
</Progress.Root>
```

## Examples

<Example id="basic" />

### Min and Max

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify a different bound by changing the
value of the `max` prop. You can do the same with the minimum value by setting the `min` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress from `10` to `30`, you can use:

<Example id="min-max" />

### Indeterminate

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to 50 and 100 respectively. To render an
indeterminate progress, you will have to set the `value` to `null`.

<Example id="indeterminate" />

### Label

Add a label to provide additional context for the progress indicator.

<Example id="with-label" />

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the progress is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useProgress` hook. This way
you can access the state and methods from outside the component.

<Example id="root-provider" />
