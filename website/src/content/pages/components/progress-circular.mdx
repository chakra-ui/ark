description: An element that shows either determinate or indeterminate progress.

<ComponentPreview id="ProgressCircular" />

## Anatomy

To set up the progress correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="circular-progress" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Progress` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Min and Max

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify a different bound by changing the
value of the `max` prop. You can do the same with the minimum value by setting the `min` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress from `10` to `30`, you can use:

<Example id="min-max" />

### Indeterminate

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to 50 and 100 respectively. To render an
indeterminate progress, you will have to set the `value` to `null`.

<Example id="indeterminate" />

### Label

Add a label to provide additional context for the progress indicator.

<Example id="with-label" />

### Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the progress. It accepts the value of the `useProgress` hook. You
can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the progress.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
