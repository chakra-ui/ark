## Anatomy

To set up the steps correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="steps" />

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a basic example of the `Steps` component.

<Example component="steps" id="basic" />

### Controlled

Using the `RootProvider` component, you can control the active step by using the `step` prop and handling the
`onStepChange` event.

<Example id="controlled" />

### Vertical

Use the `orientation` prop to display the steps vertically.

<Example id="vertical" />

### Root Provider

An alternative way to control the steps is to use the `RootProvider` component and the `useSteps` store hook.

This way you can access the steps state and methods from outside the steps.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
