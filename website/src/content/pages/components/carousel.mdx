## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="carousel" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Carousel` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic
example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Carousel

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the carousel using the
`index` prop and update it when the `onIndexChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Customizing the Carousel

You can customize the Carousel component by setting various props. Here's an example of a customized
Carousel:

<Example id="customized" />

### Using the Root Provider

The `RootProvider` component provides a context for the carousel. It accepts the value of the `useCarousel` hook.
You can leverage it to access the component state and methods from outside the carousel.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Root` component.
