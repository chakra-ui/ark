## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="carousel" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Carousel` component in your project. Let's take a look at the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled

To create a controlled Carousel component, you can manage the state of the carousel using the `page` prop and update it
when the `onPageChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Root Provider

Use the `useCarousel` hook to create the carousel store and pass it to the `Carousel.RootProvider` component. This
allows you to have maximum control over the carousel programmatically.

<Example id="root-provider" />

> If you're using the `Carousel.RootProvider` component, you don't need to use the `Carousel.Root` component.

### Autoplay

Pass the `autoplay` and `loop` props to `Carousel.Root` to make the carousel play automatically.

> **Note:** Adding `loop` ensures the carousel keeps going after the last slide.

<Example id="autoplay" />

### Pause on Hover

This feature isn't built-in, but you can use the `play()` and `pause()` methods from `Carousel.Context` to implement
pause on hover.

Add the `autoplay` and `loop` props to `Carousel.Root`, then attach `onPointerOver` and `onPointerLeave` handlers to
`Carousel.ItemGroup` that call `api.pause()` and `api.play()` respectively.

<Example id="pause-on-hover" />

### Thumbnail Indicators

Replace default indicator dots with image thumbnails. Render each thumbnail inside `Carousel.Indicator` to create a
visual preview of each slide:

<Example id="thumbnail-indicator" />

### Vertical Orientation

Set the `orientation="vertical"` prop on `Carousel.Root` to change the carousel from horizontal to vertical scrolling.
This is useful for vertical galleries or content feeds.

<Example id="vertical" />

### Dynamic Slides

Manage slides dynamically by storing them in state and syncing the carousel page. Pass the `page` prop and
`onPageChange` handler to `Carousel.Root`, and update `slideCount` when slides are added or removed. This demonstrates
bidirectional state synchronization between your component state and the carousel.

<Example id="dynamic-slides" />

### Scroll to Slide

Use `Carousel.Context` to access the carousel API and call `api.scrollToIndex(index)` to programmatically navigate to a
specific slide. This is useful for creating custom navigation or jump-to-slide functionality.

<Example id="scroll-to" />

### Slides Per Page

Display multiple slides simultaneously by setting the `slidesPerPage` prop on `Carousel.Root`. Use `api.pageSnapPoints`
from `Carousel.Context` to render the correct number of indicators based on pages rather than individual slides. Add the
`spacing` prop to control the gap between slides.

<Example id="slides-per-page" />

### Spacing

Control the gap between slides using the `spacing` prop on `Carousel.Root`. Combine it with `slidesPerPage` to create
layouts that show partial previews of adjacent slides.

<Example id="spacing" />

### Variable Size Slides

Enable variable-width slides by setting the `autoSize` prop on `Carousel.Root`. Each `Carousel.Item` can have its own
width, and the carousel will adapt accordingly. Use the `snapAlign` prop on individual items to control their snap
position.

<Example id="variable-size" />
