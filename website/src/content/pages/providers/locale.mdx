description: Locale provider for setting the locale and direction of the app.

## Setup

The `LocaleProvider` component sets the locale for your app, formatting dates, numbers, and other locale-specific data.

> **Note:** If no `LocaleProvider` is setup, the default locale for the app will be `en-US` and therefore the direction will be `ltr`.

## Usage

To access the current locale and direction settings, use the `useLocaleContext` hook.
