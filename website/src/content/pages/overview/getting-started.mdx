<Step number="3" title="Add a component">

In this guide, we will be adding a Slider component. Copy the following code to your project.

<Example component="slider" id="basic"  />

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Style a component">
Ark UI is a headless component library that doesn't include default styles.
You can leverage the `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to style your components with custom CSS.

For example, to style a slider component, you can target its parts using these attributes:

```css
/* Targets the <Slider.Root /> */
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='root'] {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Check out the [Styling Components guide](/docs/react/guides/styling) to learn more about styling components in Ark UI.
