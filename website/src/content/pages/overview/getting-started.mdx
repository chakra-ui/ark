Before you start, ensure you have a proper project setup. If not, follow your preferred application
framework setup guide and then return to this guide.

</Step>
<Step title="Install Ark UI" number="2">

<Step number="3" title="Add a component">

In this guide, we will be adding a Slider component. Copy the following code to your project.

<Example component="slider" id="basic" />

</Step>

<Step number="4" title="Style a component">
Ark UI is a headless component library that doesn't include default styles.
You can leverage the `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to style your components with custom CSS.

For example, to style a slider component, you can target its parts using these attributes:

```css
/* Targets the <Slider.Root /> */
[data-scope='slider'][data-part='root'] {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Check out the [Styling Components guide](/react/docs/guides/styling) to learn more about styling
components in Ark UI.

<Step number="5" title="That's it">

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and styled your components using Ark UI. If you run into
any issues or have questions, open an issue on our
