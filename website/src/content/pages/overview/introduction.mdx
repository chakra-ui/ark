## Motivation

Most popular UI component libraries are designed to work with a specific JavaScript framework. Building UI components
that work across different JavaScript frameworks presents significant challenges for organizations working with diverse
technology stacks.

## Solution

Ark UI provides components for building complex, interactive, and accessible user interfaces across multiple JavaScript
frameworks. To achieve this, Ark UI is built on top of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com), a UI component library powered by
Finite State Machines. Check out the architecture diagram below for a high-level overview.
