# LLMs.txt

## What is LLMs.txt?

We support [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for making the Ark UI documentation available to large language models
(LLMs). This feature helps AI tools better understand our component library, its APIs, and usage patterns.

## Available Routes

We provide several LLMs.txt routes to help AI tools access our documentation:

- [llms.txt](https://ark-ui.com/llms.txt) - Contains a structured overview of all components and their documentation
  links
- [llms-full.txt](https://ark-ui.com/llms-full.txt) - Provides comprehensive documentation including implementation
  details and examples
- [llms-react.txt](https://ark-ui.com/llms-react.txt) - React-specific documentation and implementation details
- [llms-solid.txt](https://ark-ui.com/llms-solid.txt) - SolidJS-specific documentation and implementation details
- [llms-vue.txt](https://ark-ui.com/llms-vue.txt) - Vue-specific documentation and implementation details
- [llms-svelte.txt](https://ark-ui.com/llms-svelte.txt) - Svelte-specific documentation and implementation details

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Use the `@Docs` feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project. This helps Cursor provide more accurate
code suggestions and documentation for Ark UI components.

### Windstatic

Reference the LLMs.txt files using `@` or in your `.windsurfrules` files to enhance Windstatic's understanding of Ark UI
components.

### Other AI Tools

Any AI tool that supports LLMs.txt can use these routes to better understand Ark UI. Simply point your tool to any of
the routes above based on your framework of choice.
