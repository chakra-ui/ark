## The asChild Prop

In Ark UI, the `asChild` prop lets you integrate custom components, ensuring consistent styling and
behavior while promoting flexibility and reusability. All Ark components that render a DOM element
accept the `asChild` prop.

Here's an example using `asChild` to integrate a custom `Button` component within a `Popover`:

<Example id="as-child" component="popover" />

In this example, the `asChild` prop allows the `Button` to be used as the trigger for the `Popover`,
inheriting its behaviors from Popover.Trigger.

## The Ark Factory

You can use the `ark` factory to create your own elements that work just like Ark UI components.

<Example id="factory" component="popover" />

This will produce the following HTML:

```html
<span id="child" class="parent child" style="background: red; color: blue;">Ark UI</span>
```

## Limitations

When using the `asChild` prop, ensure you pass only a single child element. Passing multiple children may cause rendering issues.

Certain components, such as `Checkbox.Root` or `RadioGroup.Item`, have specific requirements for their child elements.
For instance, they may require a label element as a child.
If you change the underlying element type, ensure it remains accessible and functional.
