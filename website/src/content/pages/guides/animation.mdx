Adding animation to Ark UI Components is as straightforward as with any other component, but keep in
mind some considerations when working with exit animations with JavaScript animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS

The most straightforward method to animate your elements is using CSS. You can animate both the
mounting and unmounting phases with CSS. The latter is achievable because Ark UI Components
postpones the unmounting while your animation runs.

Below is a simple example of creating a fade-in and fade-out animation using CSS keyframes:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

You can use these keyframes to animate any element during its lifecycle. For instance, to apply the
`fadeIn` animation when your `Tooltip` enters the 'open' state, and `fadeOut` when it enters the
'closed' state, you could use the following styles:

```css
[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in;
}
```

## Animating with JS Libraries

There's plenty of versatility when it comes to animating your Ark UI Elements with JavaScript
libraries. Various libraries such as GreenSock, anime.js, Framer Motion, and more can add a new
level of interaction and feedback to your UI components.

One significant advantage of using Ark UI Elements is the control you have over the unmounting phase
of your components. This is primarily facilitated through the `present` prop. The `present` prop
allows the component to stay mounted even after its enclosing condition has been falsified, allowing
for exit animations to complete before the component is removed from the DOM.
