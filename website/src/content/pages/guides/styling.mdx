## Overview

Ark UI is a headless component library that works with any styling solution. It provides functional
styles for elements like popovers for positioning, while leaving presentation styles up to you. Some
components also expose CSS variables that can be used for styling or animations.

### Data Attributes

Ark UI components use `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes to target specific elements within a
component. Interactive components often include `data-*` attributes to indicate their state. For
example, here's what an open accordion item looks like:

```html
<div data-scope="accordion" data-part="item" data-state="open"></div>
```

For more details on each component's data attributes, refer to their respective documentation.

## Styling with CSS

When styling components with CSS, you can target the data attributes assigned to each component part
for easy customization.

### Styling a Part

To style a specific component part, target its `data-scope` and `data-part` attributes:

```css
[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item'] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
}
```

### Styling a State

To style a component based on its state, use the `data-state` attribute:

```css
[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item'][data-state='open'] {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
```

> **Tip:** If you prefer using classes instead of data attributes, utilize the `class` or
> `className` prop to add custom classes to Ark UI components.

## Styling with Panda CSS

[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com) is a build-time CSS-in-JS framework that integrates seamlessly
with Ark UI, providing an efficient styling solution.

### Styling a part

Panda offers various ways to write styles, but in the context of Ark UI, we recommend using the
`defineSlotRecipe` function to style a component with its different parts and variants.

```ts
import { accordionAnatomy } from '@ark-ui/anatomy'
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const accordionStyles = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'accordion',
  slots: accordionAnatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    item: {
      borderBottom: '1px solid #e5e5e5',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {},
  variants: {},
})
```

### Styling a state

To style a component based on its state, you can use build in
[conditions](https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/conditions) in Panda CSS.

```ts
import { accordionAnatomy } from '@ark-ui/anatomy'
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const accordionStyles = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'accordion',
  slots: accordionAnatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    item: {
      borderBottom: '1px solid {colors.gray.300}',
      _open: { // [!code highlight]
        backgroundColor: 'gray.100',
      },
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {},
  variants: {},
})
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework providing a flexible way
to style your components.

### Styling a Part

To style a part, apply classes directly to the parts using either `class` or `className`, depending
on the JavaScript framework.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="border-b border-gray-300">{/* … */}</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Styling a State

Leverage Tailwind CSS's variant selector to style a component based on its data-state attribute.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item className="border-b border-gray-300 data-[state=open]:bg-gray-100">
    {/* … */}
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```
