description: Learn how to access the state of a component using Context and Provider components.

## Motivation

Components in Ark UI use declarative syntax, making them easier to reason about and compose.
However, there are times when you need to access a component's state from a parent or child component.

## Context Components

Context components allow you to access a component's state or functions from a child component. 
In the example below, `Avatar.Fallback` conditionally renders based on the `loaded` state.

<Example id="context" component="avatar" />

## Provider Components

Provider components can be used instead of root components, particularly useful for combining multiple components into a single component.

<Example id="provider" component="avatar" />

In our new [Examples](/react/examples) section, you can find more examples of how to compose components using `Context` and `Provider` components.
