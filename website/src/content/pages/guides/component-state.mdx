## Motivation

Effectively accessing and managing component state is crucial for dynamic UIs in Ark.
Using `Context` and `Provider` components, you can write modular, maintainable code.
This guide shows how to share state and behavior across your application,
enabling flexible and powerful component compositions.

## Context Components

Context components allow you to access a component's state or functions from a child component.
In the example below, `Avatar.Fallback` conditionally renders based on the `loaded` state.

<Example id="context" component="avatar" />

> **Good to know (RSC)**: Due to the usage of render prop, you might need to add the `'use client'` directive
> at the top of your file when using React Server Components.

## Provider Components

Provider components can help coordinate state and behavior between multiple components,
enabling interactions that aren't possible with `Context` components alone.

<Example id="provider" component="avatar" />
