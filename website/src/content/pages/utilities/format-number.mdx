description: Used to format numbers to a specific locale and options

<ComponentPreview id="FormatNumber" />

## Usage

The number formatting logic is handled by the native `Intl.NumberFormat` API and
smartly cached to avoid performance issues when using the same locale and
options.

```jsx
import { Format } from '@ark-ui/react'
```

## Examples

### Basic

Use the `Format.Number` component to format a number with default options.

<Example component="format" id="number-basic" />

### Percentage

Use the `style="percent"` prop to format the number as a percentage.

<Example component="format" id="number-with-percentage" />

### Currency

Use the `style="currency"` prop along with the `currency` prop to format the number as a currency.

<Example component="format" id="number-with-currency" />

### Locale

Use the `locale` prop to format the number according to a specific locale.

<Example component="format" id="number-with-locale" />

### Unit

Use the `style="unit"` prop along with the `unit` prop to format the number with a specific unit.

<Example component="format" id="number-with-unit" />

### Compact Notation

Use the `notation="compact"` prop to format the number in compact notation.

<Example component="format" id="number-with-compact" />
