## Motivation

Focus trapping is essential for modal interfaces and other interactive elements that require user
attention.

The `FocusTrap` component helps maintain accessibility by ensuring keyboard focus remains within a
designated container until explicitly released.

## Examples

<Example id="basic" />

### Autofocus

The focus trap respects elements with the `autofocus` attribute.

<Example id="autofocus" />

### Initial Focus

Use the `initialFocus` prop to set the element that should receive initial focus when the trap is
activated.

<Example id="initial-focus" />
