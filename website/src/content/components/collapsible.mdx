## Animation

You can use CSS animations to create smooth transitions for opening and closing the Collapsible content. 
Utilize the `data-state` attribute in combination with the `--height` CSS variable to animate the open and closed states.

```css
@keyframes slideDown {
  from { height: 0; }
  to { height: var(--height); }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from { height: var(--height); }
  to { height: 0; }
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: slideDown 250ms;
}

[data-scope='accordion'][data-part='item-content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: slideUp 200ms;
}
```

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Collapsible` component in your project. Let's examine
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Events

You can listen for the `onExitComplete` event to know when the `Collapsible.Content` is no longer visible:

<Story id="OnExitComplete" />

### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of the `Collapsible.Content`, use the `lazyMount` prop:

<Story id="LazyMount" />

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the `Collapsible.Content` from the DOM when it is not visible, use the
`unmountOnExit` prop:

<Story id="UnmountOnExit" />

### Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined to ensure that the component is
mounted only when the `Collapsible` is expanded and unmounted when it is collapsed:

<Story id="LazyMountAndUnmountOnExit" />
