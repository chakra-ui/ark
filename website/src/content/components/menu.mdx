## Anatomy

To set up the menu correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="menu" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Menu` component in your project. Let's take a look at the
most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Listening to item selection

Pass the `onSelect` prop to the Menu component to perform some custom logic when
an item is selected. The callback is invoked with the `id` of the item.

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Grouping menu items

When the number of menu items gets much, it might be useful to group related
menu items. To achieve this, render the `Menu.ItemGroup` component around the
`Menu.Item` components. The `Menu.ItemGroupLabel` component can be used to add a
label to the group.

<Story id="Group" />

### Separating menu items

To separate menu items, render the `Menu.Separator` component.

<Story id="Separator" />

### Context menu

To show the menu when a trigger element is right-clicked, use the
`Menu.ContextTrigger` component.

Context menus are also opened during a long-press of roughly `700ms` when the
pointer is pen or touch.

<Story id="Context" />

### Nested menu

To show a nested menu, render another `Menu` component and use the
`Menu.TriggerItem` component to open the submenu.

<Story id="Nested" />

### Checkbox

To add a checkbox to a menu item, use the `Menu.Checkbox` component.

<Story id="Checkbox" />

### Radio Group

To group radio option items, use the `Menu.RadioGroup` component.

<Story id="RadioGroup" />
