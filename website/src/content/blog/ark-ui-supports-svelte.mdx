Weâ€™re excited to announce that Ark UI now officially supports Svelte! ðŸŽ‰

If you're part of the Svelte community, you can now build accessible, scalable UIs and design systems using Ark UI,
while keeping that reactive Svelte experience you already love.

Svelte has become a go-to for developers who care about speed and minimal overhead. That lines up perfectly with how Ark
UI is built - totally unopinionated. In other words, you get all the complex accessibility logic handled for you, while
maintaining complete control over styling and behavior.

## Getting Started is Simple!

Install Ark UI for Svelte directly via your package manager:

```bash
npm i @ark-ui/svelte
# or
yarn add @ark-ui/svelte
# or
pnpm add @ark-ui/svelte
```

Hereâ€™s a quick example of what using `<Slider>` in Svelte looks like:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'
</script>

<Slider.Root>
  <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
  <Slider.ValueText />
  <Slider.Control>
    <Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Range />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>
```

There are already 45+ components available in Ark UI, so whether you're building a product or a design system, you can
now ship Svelte apps faster!

We canâ€™t wait to see what you build with it!
