Today, we're excited to introduce the **Ark UI MCP Server** - a server that provides a comprehensive knowledge base
about Ark UI to AI agents.

This server is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) , and gives AI assistants structured access to the Ark UI
component system, allowing them to generate, suggest, and style framework-agnostic components consistently across React,
Vue, Solid, and Svelte.

## Available Tools

The MCP Server exposes several tools that AI assistants can call:

- **`list_components`**: Returns a full list of all available components
- **`list_examples`**: Lists various component examples
- **`get_example`**: Retrieves code examples and usage patterns
- **`styling_guide`**: Provides styling guidelines for components (data attributes and CSS variables)

## Framework Demos

Let's take a look at how different AI tools build Ark UI components using the MCP Server.

### React: Building a Checkbox w/ Copilot

**Using VSCode Copilot** to generate a closed checkbox component in React.

## Using the MCP Server

Connect the MCP Server to your IDE or AI assistant of choice via the following steps:

### Configure the MCP Server

To get started with the MCP server, add this to your AI tool's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chakra-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/react-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Start the MCP Server

In some IDEs (like VSCode), you might need to start the MCP server manually. Click the "Start" button.

## Conclusion

The Ark UI MCP Server helps you build design systems in any framework. Check out the **[MCP docs](/docs/ai/mcp-server)**
to setup the server in your favorite IDE.
