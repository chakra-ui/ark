From the onset, Ark UI supported React, Solid and Vue. Today, we're excited to announce that Ark UI now officially
supports Svelte! ðŸŽ‰

This means you can now build accessible, scalable design systems using the **45+ components** in Ark UI, while keeping
that reactive Svelte experience you already love (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, you get the gist!).

## Why Svelte?

Svelte has become a go-to for developers who care about speed and minimal overhead. That lines up perfectly with how Ark
UI is built - totally unopinionated. In other words, you get all the complex accessibility logic handled for you, while
maintaining complete control over styling and behavior.

## Getting Started

> **Note:** Ark UI only works for Svelte 5 apps and design systems.

To get started with Ark UI, install the `@ark-ui/svelte` package directly via your package manager:

```bash
npm i @ark-ui/svelte
# or
yarn add @ark-ui/svelte
# or
pnpm add @ark-ui/svelte
```

## Quick Demo

Here's a quick example of how to use `Slider` component in Svelte:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Slider } from '@ark-ui/svelte/slider'

  let value = $state(0)
</script>

<Slider.Root bind:value>
  <Slider.Label>Label</Slider.Label>
  <Slider.ValueText />
  <Slider.Control>
    <Slider.Track>
      <Slider.Range />
    </Slider.Track>
    <Slider.Thumb index={0}>
      <Slider.HiddenInput />
    </Slider.Thumb>
  </Slider.Control>
</Slider.Root>
```

## Conclusion

There are already **45+ components** available in Ark UI, so whether you're building a product or a design system, you
can now ship Svelte apps faster!
