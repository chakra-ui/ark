title: Accordion
description:
  The Accordion is a highly customizable and intuitive component that allows you
  to present your content in a collapsible style. It is ideal for scenarios
  where you want to manage a large amount of content or information in a limited
  space, such as FAQs, menus, or lists.

import Playground from '~/components/playground.astro'
import Story from '~/components/story.astro'

## Usage

Start by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  AccordionContent,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

## Setting an Initial Panel

To set an initial panel to be open upon rendering, use the `defaultValue` prop:

<Story id="Initial" />

## Using Render Props

For more control over the Accordion's functionality, you can use a function as a
child, which provides access to the Accordion API:

<Story id="RenderProp" />

## Making the Accordion Collapsible

For a collapsible Accordion where all panels can be closed simultaneously, use
the `collapsible` prop:

<Story id="Collapsible" />

## Opening Multiple Panels

For an Accordion that allows multiple panels to be open at once, use the
`multiple` prop:

<Story id="Multiple" />

## Controlled Accordion

To create a controlled Accordion component, manage the state of the currently
opened panels using the `value` prop and update it when the `onChange` event
handler is called:

<Story id="Controlled" />

## Changing the Orientation

To display the Accordion in a vertical orientation, use the `orientation` prop:

<Story id="Vertical" />

## Disabling an Accordion Item

To disable an AccordionItem, use the `disabled` prop:

<Story id="Disabled" />

## Conclusion

The Accordion component offers a clean and compact solution to manage and
display content in a way that's organized and efficient. Its extensive set of
props and configurations can accommodate a variety of use cases and designs.
