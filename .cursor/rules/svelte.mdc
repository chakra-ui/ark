- Make sure to export the `*BaseProps`
- `children?: Snippet` already exists in `HTMLArkProps<X>` so no need to define it
- Every `use*` hook must return and `Accessor<T>`
- For `*-root.svelte` files where `value` or `open` is a valid prop, make sure you setup the `$bindable()` for it.
- For `*-context.svelte` files, prefer to use `render` not `children` prop

### Exporting Files

- Always export pattern is `export { default as Component }`
- Check the exports against the react package and make sure they're the same

### Creating Stories

- When creating stories, keep the format simple
- Imports must have a `Example` suffix
- All imports in examples must use `@ark-ui/svelte/<component>`

```tsx
import BasicExample from "./examples/basic.svelte"

const meta: Meta = {
  title: 'Components / <component>',
}

export default meta

export const Basic = {
  render: () => ({
    Component: BasicExample,
  }),
}
```
