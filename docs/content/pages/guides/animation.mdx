  Animate your Ark UI Components with CSS keyframes or your favorite JavaScript
  animation library.

Adding animation to Ark UI Components is as straightforward as with any other
component, but keep in mind some considerations when working with exit
animations with JavaScript animation libraries.

## Animating with CSS

The most straightforward method to animate your elements is using CSS. You can
animate both the mounting and unmounting phases with CSS. The latter is
achievable because Ark UI Components postpones the unmounting while your
animation runs.

Below is a simple example of creating a fade-in and fade-out animation using CSS
keyframes:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

You can use these keyframes to animate any element during its lifecycle. For
instance, to apply the `fadeIn` animation when your `Tooltip` enters the 'open'
state, and `fadeOut` when it enters the 'closed' state, you could use the
following styles:

```css
[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='open'] {
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out;
}

[data-scope='tooltip'][data-part='content'][data-state='closed'] {
  animation: fadeOut 300ms ease-in;
}
```

## Animating with JS Libraries

There's plenty of versatility when it comes to animating your Ark UI Elements
with JavaScript libraries. Various libraries such as GreenSock, anime.js, Framer
Motion, and more can add a new level of interaction and feedback to your UI
components.

One significant advantage of using Ark UI Elements is the control you have over
the unmounting phase of your components. This is primarily facilitated through
the `present` prop. The `present` prop allows the component to stay mounted even
after its enclosing condition has been falsified, allowing for exit animations
to complete before the component is removed from the DOM.
