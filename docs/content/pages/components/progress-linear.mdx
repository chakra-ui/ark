## Anatomy

To set up the progress correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="linear-progress" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Progress` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Setting the initial value

To set the progress's initial value, set the `defaultValue` prop to a number.

<Example id="initialValue" />

### Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily
specify a different bound by changing the value of the `max` prop. You can do
the same with the minimum value by setting the `min` prop.

For example, to show the user a progress from `10` to `30`, you can use:

<Example id="minMax" />

### Using the indeterminate state

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to
50 and 100 respectively.

Set the `state` to `indeterminate` in `Progress.Indicator`:

<Example id="indeterminate" />

### Showing a value text

Progress bars can only be interpreted by sighted users. To include a text
description to support assistive technologies like screen readers, use the
`value` part in `translations`.

<Example id="valueText" />

### Changing the orientation

By default, the progress is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation
to vertical, set the orientation property in the machine's context to vertical.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical progress by specifying its
> height

<Example id="vertical" />
