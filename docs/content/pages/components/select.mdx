<ComponentPreview id="Select" />

## Anatomy

To set up the select correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="select" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Select` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Advanced Customization

For advanced customizations and item properties like `disabled`:

<Example id="advanced" />

### Multiple Selection

To enable `multiple` item selection:

<Example id="multiple" />

### Controlled Component

For scenarios where you want to control the Select component's state:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Usage with a Form Library

See how to use the Select component with popular form libraries:

<Example id="formLibrary" />

## TypeScript Caveats in Vue
Under the hood for React and Solid frameworks, we supply a complex prop type with a generic so that the type of the `items` prop matches the param type in the function signatures for props such as the `isItemDisabled` prop, say. (See the api reference table below) Unfortunately, generic typing is not supported in Vue for components that contain props with slots and/or emits. Therefore, you will not expect updated typing in this way.

If you have a solution or a workaround to this problem, we would love the contribution and request that you [open a Github idea discussion](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark/discussions/new?category=ideas) to let us know a PoC you have to share!
