## Anatomy

To set up the switch correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="switch" />

### Design impact on the asChild property

The `Switch.Root` element of the switch is a `label` element. This is because
the switch is a form control and should be associated with a label to provide
context and meaning to the user. Otherwise, the HTML and accessibility structure
will be invalid.

> If you need to use the `asChild` property, make sure that the `label` element
> is the direct child of the `Switch.Root` component.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Switch` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Switch

For a controlled Switch component, the state of the toggle is managed using the
checked prop, and updates when the `onCheckedChange` event handler is called:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Render Prop Usage

The Switch component also allows for a render prop, granting direct access to
its internal state. This enables you to dynamically adjust and customize aspects
of the component based on its current state:

<Example id="renderProp" />
