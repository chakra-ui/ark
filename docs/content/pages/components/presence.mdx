title: Presence
description:
  Helps control the rendering and unmounting of your content based on a given
  state.

## Examples

By default the child component starts out as hidden and remains hidden after the
`present` state is toggled off. This is useful for situations where the element
needs to be hidden initially and continue to stay hidden after its presence is
no longer required.

<Example id="basic" />

### Lazy Mount

To delay the mounting of a child component until the `present` prop is set to
true, use the `lazyMount` prop:

<Example id="lazyMount" />

### Unmount on Exit

To remove the child component from the DOM when it's not present, use the
`unmountOnExit` prop:

<Example id="unmountOnExit" />

### Combining Lazy Mount and Unmount on Exit

Both `lazyMount` and `unmountOnExit` can be combined for a component to be
mounted only when it's present and to be unmounted when it's no longer present:

<Example id="lazyMountAndUnmountOnExit" />
