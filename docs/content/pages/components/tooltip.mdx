## Anatomy

To set up the tooltip correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="tooltip" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Tooltip` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Controlled Tooltip

To create a controlled Tooltip component, manage the state of whether the
tooltip is open using the `open` prop:

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Using a Render Function

For more control over the Tooltip's functionality, you can use a function as a
child, which provides access to the Tooltip API:

<Story id="RenderFn" />

### Adding an Arrow

To display an arrow pointing to the trigger from the tooltip, use the
`Tooltip.Arrow` and `Tooltip.ArrowTip` components:

<Story id="Arrow" />

### Configuring Delay Timings

To configure the delay timings for the Tooltip, use the `closeDelay` and
`openDelay` props:

<Story id="Timings" />

### Custom Positioning

To customize the position of the Tooltip relative to the trigger, use the
`positioning` prop:

<Story id="Positioning" />
