## Anatomy

To set up the date picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `DatePicker` component in your project. Let's take a look
at the most basic example

### Range Selection

To create a Date Picker that allows a range selection, set the `selectionMode`
prop to `range`.

<Story id="Range" />

### Standalone Date Picker

In some cases, you might want to display a non-dismissible date picker. This can
be achieved by setting the `open` prop to `true` and `closeOnSelect` prop to
`false`.

> Important to note that standalone date picker doesn't use the `Portal`,
> `Positioner` and `Content` components.
