## Anatomy

To set up the avatar correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="accordion" />

## Examples

### Multiple Panels Open

For an Accordion that allows keeping multiple panels open, apply the `multiple`
prop:

```jsx
// [!code highlight:2]
<Accordion.Root multiple>
  <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
    …
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="item-2">
    …
  </Accordion.Item>
</AccordionRoot>
```
