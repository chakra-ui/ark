## Anatomy

To use the dialog component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="dialog" />

## Examples

Learn how to use the `Dialog` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example

<Example id="basic" />

### Controlled Dialog

To create a controlled Dialog component, manage the state of the dialog using
the `open` and `onOpenChange` props:

<Example id="controlled" />

### Lazy Mounting

Lazy mounting is a feature that allows the content of a dialog to be rendered
only when the dialog is first opened. This is useful for performance
optimization, especially when dialog content is large or complex. To enable lazy
mounting, use the `lazyMount` prop on the `Dialog.Root` component.

In addition, the `unmountOnExit` prop can be used in conjunction with
`lazyMount` to unmount the dialog content when the Dialog is closed, freeing up
resources. The next time the dialog is activated, its content will be
re-rendered.

<Example id="lazyMount" />

### Using Render Function

The Dialog component supports the use of a render function as a child for more
control. This allows access to dialog states like `isOpen`:

<Example id="renderFn" />
