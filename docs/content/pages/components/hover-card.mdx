## Anatomy

To set up the hover card correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

## Examples

Learn how to use the `HoverCard` component in your project. Let's take a look at
the most basic example:

<Story id="Basic" />

### Controlled HoverCard

The controlled `HoverCard` component provides an interface for managing the
state of the hover card using the `open` and `onOpenChange` props:

<Story id="Controlled" />

### Custom Positioning

The `HoverCard` component can be customized in its placement and distance from
the trigger element through the `positioning` prop:

<Story id="Positioning" />

### Render Prop Usage

The `HoverCard` component can also accept a render prop, giving the user more
control over rendering behavior. This is useful for dynamically updating the
trigger based on the state of the `HoverCard`:

<Story id="RenderProp" />
